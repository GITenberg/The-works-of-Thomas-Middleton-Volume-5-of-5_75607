<p class='c033'><i>The Inner-Temple Masque. Or Masque of Heroes. Presented
(as an Entertainement for many worthy Ladies:) By Gentlemen
of the same Ancient and Noble House. Tho. Middleton. London
Printed for John Browne, and are to be sold at his Shop in S.
Dunstanes Church-yard in Fleetstreete.</i> 1619. 4to.</p>

</div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c034'>It was licensed—“1619 10 July The Temple Maske.—An
1618:” see Chalmers’s <i>Suppl. Apol.</i> p. 202.</p>

<p class='c035'>Langbaine (<i>Acc. of Engl. Dram. Poets</i>, p. 372) having said,
in his notice of this Masque, that Mrs. Behn “has taken <i>part</i>
of it into the <i>City Heiress</i>,” we are told in the <i>Biographia
Dramatica</i>, that “Mrs. Behn has introduced into the <i>City
Heiress a</i> <span class='fss'>GREAT</span> <i>part</i> of <i>The Inner-Temple Masque</i>;” and
Warton “believes” that the Masque “is <i>the foundation</i>” of
Mrs. Behn’s play, <i>Hist. of English Poetry</i>, vol. ii. p. 399 (note).
Now the fact is, that Mrs. Behn has not borrowed a single
line of the <i>City Heiress</i> from <i>The Inner-Temple Masque</i>! Langbaine,
who in his list of Middleton’s dramas omits <i>A Mad
World, my Masters</i>, applies, by mistake, to <i>The Inner-Temple
Masque</i> a remark which he had prepared for his notice of that
play, and which he repeats when he mentions the comedy in
his Appendix. He also states that the Masque was first
printed in 1640—which is the date of the second edition (the
earliest he had seen) of <i>A Mad World, my Masters</i>—and hence
the <i>Biogr. Dram.</i> gives a second edition of the Masque in
1640!</p>

<p class='c052'>After most hearty commendations, my kind and
unknown friends, trusting in Phœbus your understandings
are all in as good health as Simplicity’s
was at the writing hereof; this is to certify you
further, that this short and small treatise that follows,
called a <i>Masque</i>, the device further intituled
<i>The World tost at Tennis</i>—how it will be now tossed
in the world, I know not—a toy brought to the
press rather by the printer than the poet, who
requested an epistle for his pass, to satisfy his perusers
how hitherto he hath behaved himself. First,
for his conception, he was begot in Brainford,<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c015'><sup>[217]</sup></a>
born on the bank-side of Helicon, brought up
amongst noble gentle commons and good scholars
of all sorts, where, for his time, he did good and
honest service beyond the small seas: he was fair-spoken,
never accused of scurrilous or obscene
language, a virtue not ever found in scenes of the
like condition; of as honest meaning reputed, as
his words reported; neither too bitterly taxing, nor
too soothingly telling, the world’s broad abuses;
moderately merry, as sententiously serious; never
condemned but for his brevity in speech, ever
wishing his tale longer, to be assured he would
continue to so good a purpose. Having all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>handsome qualities simply, and no other compounded
with knavery, there is great hope he shall
pass still by the fair way of good report, persevering
in those honest courses which may become the son
of Simplicity, who, though he be now in a masque,
yet is his face apparent enough. And so, loving
cousins, having no news to send you at this time,
but that Deceit is entering upon you, whom I pray
you have a care to avoid; and this notice I can
give you of him,—there are some six or eight
pages before him, the Lawyer and the Devil behind
him. In this care I leave you, not leaving to be</p>

lookest as if thou hadst lost a field to-day.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Sol.</span> No, but I have lost a day i’ the field: if
you take me a maunding<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c015'><sup>[223]</sup></a> but where I am commanding,

there’s martial danger in that, believe it.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Sol.</span> No, sir; but I was bold to shew myself to
some of my old and familiar acquaintance, but
being disguised with my wants, there’s nobody
knew me.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Scho.</span> Faith, and that’s the worst disguise a man
can walk in; thou wert better have appeared drunk

over-swearing, over-lying, over-whoring;
these add still to his repute: ’tis the poor indigence,
the want, the lank deficiency,—as when a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>man cannot be brave, dares not be bold, is afraid
to swear, wants maintenance for a lie, and money
to give a whore a supper; this is <i>pauper cujus modicum
non satis est</i>: nay, he shall never be rich with
begging neither, which is another wonder, because
many beggars are rich.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Sol.</span> O <i>canina facundia</i>! this dog-eloquence of
thine will make thee somewhat one day, scholar:
couldst thou turn but this prose into rhyme, there
were a pitiful living to be picked out of it.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Scho.</span> I could make ballads for a need.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Sol.</span> Very well, sir, and I’ll warrant thee thou
shalt never want subject to write of: one hangs
himself to-day, another drowns himself to-morrow,
a sergeant stabbed next day; here a pettifogger a’
the pillory, a bawd in the cart’s nose, and a pander
in the tail; <i>hic mulier</i>, <i>hæc vir</i>, fashions, fictions,
felonies, fooleries;—a hundred havens has the
balladmonger to traffic at, and new ones still daily
discovered.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Scho.</span> Prithee, soldier, no further this way; I
participate more of Heraclitus than Democritus;
I could rather weep the sins of the people than
sing ’em.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Sol.</span> Shall I set thee down a course to live?</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='sc'>Scho.</span> Faith, a coarse living, I think, must serve
my turn; but why hast thou not found out thine

      <div class='line'>His woof the major and his warp the minor,</div>

of our triumphs—and not to be denied of any,
how careful ought those gentlemen to be, to whose
discretion and judgment the weight and charge of
such a business is entirely referred and committed
by the whole Society, to have all things correspondent
to that generous and noble freeness of
cost and liberality; the streams of art to equal
those of bounty; a knowledge that may take the
true height of such an honourable solemnity,—the
miserable want of both which, in the impudent
common writer, hath often forced from me much
pity and sorrow; and it would heartily grieve any
understanding spirit to behold, many times, so glorious
a fire in bounty and goodness offering to
match itself with freezing Art, sitting in darkness,
with the candle out, looking like the picture of
Black Monday.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c015'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c062'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>But, to speak truth, which many beside myself
can affirm upon knowledge, a care that hath been
seldom equalled, and not easily imitated, hath been
faithfully shewn in the whole course of this business,
both by the wardens and committees, men of
much understanding, industry, and carefulness, little
weighing the greatness of expense, so the cost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>might purchase perfection, so fervent hath been
their desire to excel in that, which is a learned and
virtuous ambition, and so unfeignedly pure the
loves and affections of the whole Company to his
lordship. If any shall imagine that I set fairer
colours upon their deserts than they upon themselves,
let them but read and conceive, and their
own understandings will light them to the acknowledgment
of their errors. First, they may here
behold love and bounty opening with the morning,
earlier than some of former years, ready, at the
first appearing of his lordship, to give his ear a
taste of the day’s succeeding glory; and thus the
form of it presents itself:—</p>

an owl, a mole on one shoulder, a bat on the other,
all symbols of blind ignorance and darkness, mists
hanging at his eyes. Close before him rides Envy,
his champion, eating of a human heart, mounted
on a rhinoceros, attired in red silk, suitable to the
bloodiness of her manners; her left pap bare, where
a snake fastens; her arms half naked; holding in

figuring thereby her simplicity and nearness of
heart to those that embrace her; a robe of white

shewing her deep insight and height of wisdom;
over her thrice-sanctified head a milk-white dove,

purity, meekness, and innocency; under her feet
serpents, in that she treads down all subtlety and

the witness of her eternal descent; on her breast a
pure round crystal, shewing the brightness of her
thoughts and actions; a sun in her right hand, than
which nothing is truer; a fan, filled all with stars,
in her left, with which she parts darkness, and
strikes away the vapours of ignorance. If you

subtle object, planting itself close by the Little Conduit,
which may bear this character,—the true form

and glory thereof overspread with a thick, sulphurous
darkness, it being a fog or mist, raised
from Error, enviously to blemish that place which
bears the title of London’s Triumphant Mount, the
chief grace and lustre of the whole triumph. At
the four corners sit four monsters, Error’s disciples,
on whom hangs part of the mist for their clothing,
holding in their hands little thick clubs, coloured
like their garments; the names of these four monsters,
Barbarism, Ignorance, Impudence, Falsehood;
who, at the near approaching of Truth’s chariot,
are seen a little to tremble, whilst her deity gives

about it, the mount appearing then most rich in beauty
and glory, the four monsters falling flat at the foot
of the hill: that grave, feminine shape, figuring
London, sitting in greatest honour: next above
her, in the most eminent place, sits Religion, the
model of a fair temple on her head and a burning
lamp in her hand, the proper emblems of her sanctity,
watchfulness, and zeal; on her right hand sits
Liberality, her head circled with a wreath of gold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>in her hand a cornucopia, or horn of abundance,
out of which rusheth a seeming flood of gold, but
no way flowing to prodigality; for, as the sea is
governed by the moon, so is that wealthy river by
her eye, for bounty must be led by judgment; and
hence is artfully derived the only difference between
prodigality and bounty,—the one deals her
gifts with open eyes, the other blindfold: on her
left side sits Perfect Love, his proper seat being
nearest the heart, wearing upon his head a wreath
of white and red roses mingled together, the ancient
witness of peace, love, and union, wherein
consists the happiness of this land, his right hand
holding a sphere, where, in a circle of gold, is contained
all the Twelve Companies’ arms, and therefore
called The Sphere of true Brotherhood, or
<i>Annulus Amoris</i>, the Ring of Love: upon his left
hand stand two billing turtles, expressing thereby
the happy condition of mutual love and society:
on either side of this mount are displayed the charitable
and religious works of London—especially
the worthy Company of Grocers—in giving maintenance
to scholars, soldiers, widows, orphans, and
the like, where are placed one of each number:
and on the two heights sit Knowledge and Modesty,
Knowledge wearing a crown of stars, in her hand
a perspective glass, betokening both her high judgment
and deep insight: the brow of Modesty circled
with a wreath all of red roses, expressing her bashfulness
and blushings, in her hand a crimson banner
filled with silver stars, figuring the white purity of
her shamefastness; her cheeks not red with shame
or guilt, but with virgin fear and honour. At the
back of this Triumphant Mount, Chastity, Fame,
Simplicity, Meekness, have their seats; Chastity
wearing on her head a garland of white roses, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>her hand a white silk banner filled with stars of
gold, expressing the eternity of her unspotted pureness:
Fame next under her, on her head a crown
of silver, and a silver trumpet in her hand, shewing
both her brightness and shrillness: Simplicity with
a milk-white dove upon her head; and Meekness
with a garland of mingled flowers, in her hand a
white silk banner with a red cross, a lamb at her
feet, by which both their conditions are sufficiently
expressed. The mount thus made glorious by the
power of Truth, and the mist expelled, London
thus speaks:</p>

      <div class='line'>All world’s afflictions, calumnies, and wrongs;</div>
      <div class='line'>But having past those, then thou find’st a way</div>
      <div class='line'>In breadth whole heaven, in length eternal day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, following Truth, she brings thee to that way:</div>
      <div class='line'>But first observe what works she here requires,</div>
      <div class='line'>Religion, knowledge, sanctity, chaste desires;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then charity, which bounty must express</div>
      <div class='line'>To scholars, soldiers, widows, fatherless:</div>
      <div class='line'>These have been still my works, they must be thine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Honour and action must together shine,</div>

    <div>PRINCE CHARLES HIS CREATION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026 prose'>The day’s Triumph ended, to the great honour
of the city and content of his Highness, who, out
of the goodness of his love, gave the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen many thanks, on Monday following,
the lords and peers of the realm being all assembled
at Whitehall, his Highness then proceeded in this
manner to his creation:</p>
<p class='c026 prose'>First went [the Prince’s Gentlemen, according to
their degrees; his learned Counsel; the drums;]
the trumpets; then the Heralds and Officers of
Arms, in their rich coats; [the Earl Marshal with
his vierge;<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c015'><sup>[313]</sup></a> the Lord Chamberlain with his white
staff]; next followed the Knights of the Bath, being
six-and-twenty in number, apparelled in long robes
of purple satin, lined with white taffeta; then Sir
William Segar, knight, alias garter principal king
of arms, bearing the letters patents; the Earl of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Sussex the purple robes; the train borne by the
Earl of Huntington, the sword by the Earl of
Rutland, the ring by the Earl of Derby, the rod
by the Earl of Shrewsbury, the cap and coronet
by the Duke of Lennox lord steward. His princely
Highness, supported by the Earls of Suffolk and
Nottingham, came bareheaded, [followed by the
principal Gentlemen of his chamber], and so entered
the great hall, where the King was set in his
royal throne, and the whole state of the realm in
their order.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The Prince made low obeisance to his Majesty
three times; and after the third time, when he was
come near to the King, he kneeled down on a rich
pillow or cushion, whilst Sir Ralph Winwood, principal
secretary, read his letters patents: then his
Majesty, at the reading of the words of investment,
put the robes upon him, and girded on the sword;
invested him with the rod and ring, and set the
cap and coronet on his head. [When the patent
was fully read, it was delivered to the King, who
delivered it to the Prince, kissing him once or
twice. At the putting on of the mantle, and delivering
of the patent, the trumpets and drums
sounded.]</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>With which ceremony the creation being accomplished,
the King arose, and went up to dinner;
but the Prince, with his lords, dined in the hall,
and was served with great state and magnificence,
accompanied at his table with divers great lords,
as the Earl of Suffolk, lord treasurer; the Earl of
Arundel, lord marshal; the Earl of Nottingham,
lord admiral; the Duke of Lennox, lord steward;
the Earl of Pembroke, lord chamberlain; the Earls
of Shrewsbury, Derby, [Huntington], Rutland, and
Sussex; the Prince sitting in a chair at the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>end, and the rest in distance about four yards from
him, one over against another, in their degrees;
all which were those that were employed in several
offices of honour about his royal creation. [The
Earl of Southampton acted as cup-bearer, the Earl
of Dorset as carver, the Lord Compton as sewer,<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c015'><sup>[314]</sup></a>
and doctor Sinhowse, the Prince’s chaplain, said
grace.] At another table, in the same room, on the
left hand of the Prince, sat the Knights of the Bath,
all on one side, and had likewise great service and
attendance. [After some music, the song of forty
parts was sung by the gentlemen of the chapel and
others, sitting upon degrees over the screen at the
north end of the Hall; which was sung again by
the King’s commandment, who stood as a spectator
in the room over the stairs ascending to the Great
Chamber.] About the midst of dinner, Sir William
Segar, knight, alias garter principal king of arms,
with the rest of the King’s Heralds and Pursuivants
of Arms, approached the Prince’s table, and with a
loud and audible voice proclaimed the King’s style
in Latin, French, and English, thrice; and the
Prince’s, in like manner, twice: then the trumpets
sounding, the second course came in; and dinner
done, that day’s solemnity ceased.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>At night, to crown it with more heroical honour,
forty worthy gentlemen of the noble societies of

<p class='c023 prose'>Having thus briefly described the manner of his
Highness’ creation, with the honourable service
shewn to the solemnity both by the lords and gentlemen
of the Inns of Court, I should have set a
period, but that the Knights of the Bath, being a
principal part and ornament of this sacred triumph,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>I cannot pass them over without some remembrance:
therefore thus much out of the Note of
Directions from some of the principal officers of
arms, and some observation of credit concerning
the order and ceremonies of the knighthood:—</p>

<p class='c026 prose'>The lords and other that were to receive the
honourable order of the Bath repaired on Saturday,
the second of November, to the Parliament
House at Westminster, and there in the afternoon
heard evening prayer, observing no other ceremony
at that time, but only the heralds going before
them, in their ordinary habits, from thence to King
Henry the Seventh’s chapel at Westminster, there
to begin their warfare, as if they would employ
their service for God especially; from whence,
after service ended, they returned into the chamber
they were to sup in. Their supper was prepared
all at one table, and all sate upon one side of the
same, every man having an escutcheon of his arms
placed over his head, and certain of the King’s
officers being appointed to attend them. In this
manner, having taken their repast, several beds
were made ready for their lodging in another room
hard by, after the same manner, all on one side;
their beds were pallets with coverings, testers, or
canopies of red say,<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c015'><sup>[321]</sup></a> but they used no curtains.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The Knights in the meanwhile were withdrawn
into the bathing-chamber, which was the next room
to that which they supped in; where for each of
them was provided a several bathing-tub, which
was lined both within and without with white linen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>and covered with red say; wherein, after they have
said their prayers and commended themselves to
God, they bathe themselves, that thereby they
might be put in mind to be pure in body and soul
from thenceforth; and after the bath, they betook
themselves to their rest.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Early the next morning they were awakened
with music, and at their uprising invested in their
hermits’ habits, which was a gown of gray cloth,
girded close, and a hood of the same, and a linen
coif underneath, and an handkercher hanging at
his girdle, cloth stockings soled with leather, but
no shoes; and thus apparelled, their esquires governors,
with the heralds wearing the coats of arms,
and sundry sorts of wind instruments before them,
they proceed from their lodging, the meanest in
order foremost, as the night before, until they came
to the chapel, where, after service ended, their oath
was ministered unto them by the Earl of Arundel,
lord marshal, and the Earl of Pembroke, lord chamberlain,
in a solemn and ceremonious manner, all
of them standing forth before their stalls, and at
their coming out making low reverence towards
the altar, by which the commissioners sate: then
were they brought up by the heralds by two at
once, the chiefest first, and so the rest, till all successively
had received their oath,<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c015'><sup>[322]</sup></a> which in effect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>was this: That above all things they should seek
the honour of God, and maintenance of true religion;
love their sovereign; serve their country;
help maidens, widows, and orphans; and, to the
utmost of their power, cause equity and justice to
be observed.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>This day, whilst they were yet in the chapel,
wine and sweetmeats were brought them, and they
departed to their chamber to be disrobed of their
hermits’ weeds, and were revested in robes of crimson
taffeta, implying they should be martial men,
the robes lined with white sarcenet, in token of
sincerity, having white hats on their heads with
white feathers, white boots on their legs, and white
gloves tied unto the strings of their mantles; all
which performed, they mount on horseback, the
saddle of black leather, the arson<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c015'><sup>[323]</sup></a> white, stirrup-leathers
black gilt, the pectoral<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c015'><sup>[324]</sup></a> of black leather,
with a cross paty<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c015'><sup>[325]</sup></a> of silver thereon, and without a
crupper, the bridle likewise black, with a cross
paty on the forehead or frontlet; each knight between
his two esquires well apparelled, his footmen
attending, and his page riding before him, carrying
his sword, with the hilts upward, in a white leather
belt without buckles or studs, and his spurs hanging
thereon. In this order ranked, every man according
to his degree—the best or chiefest first—they rode
fair and softly towards the court, the trumpets
sounding, and the heralds all the way riding before
them. Being come to the King’s hall, the Marshal
meets them, who is to have their horses, or else
100s. in money, for his fee: then, conducted by
the heralds and others appointed for that purpose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>his Majesty sitting under his cloth of estate, gave
to them their knighthood in this manner:</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>First, the principal lord that is to receive the
order comes, led by his two esquires, and his
page before him bearing his sword and spurs, and
kneeleth down before his Majesty; the Lord Chamberlain
takes the sword of the page and delivers
it to the King, who puts the belt over the neck of
the knight, aslope his breast, placing the sword
under his left arm; the second nobleman of the
chief about the King puts on his spurs, the right
spur first; and so is the ceremony performed. In
this sort Lord Maltravers, son and heir to the Earl
of Arundel, lord marshal, which was the principal
of this number, being first created, the rest were
all consequently knighted alike. And when the
solemnity thereof was fully finished, they all returned
in order as they came, saving some small
difference, in that the youngest or meanest knight
went now foremost, and their pages behind them.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Coming back to the Parliament House, their
dinner was ready prepared, in the same room and
after the fashion as their supper was the night before;
but being set, they were not to taste of any
thing that stood before them, but, with a modest
carriage and graceful abstinence, to refrain; divers
kinds of sweet music sounding the while; and after
a convenient time of sitting, to arise and withdraw
themselves, leaving the table so furnished to their
esquires and pages.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>About five of the clock in the afternoon they
rode again to court, to hear service in the King’s
chapel, keeping the same order they did at their
return from thence in the morning, every knight
riding between his two esquires, and his page following
him. At their entrance into the chapel, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>heralds conducting them, they make a solemn reverence,
the youngest knight beginning, the rest
orderly ensuing; and so one after another take
their standing before their stalls, where all being
placed, the eldest knight maketh a second reverence,
which is followed to the youngest; and
then all ascend into their stalls, and take their
accustomed places. Service then beginneth, and
is very solemnly celebrated with singing of divers
anthems to the organs; and when the time of their
offertory is come, the youngest knights are summoned
forth of their stalls by the heralds, doing
reverence first within their stalls, and again after
they are descended, which is likewise imitated by
all the rest; and being all thus come forth, standing
before their stalls as at first, the two eldest
knights, with their swords in their hands, are
brought up by the heralds to the altar, where they
offer their swords, and the dean receives them, of
whom they presently redeem them with an angel<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c015'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
in gold, and then come down to their former places,
whilst two other are led up in like manner. The
ceremony performed and service ended, they depart
again in such order as they came, with accustomed
reverence. At the chapel-door, as they came
forth, they were encountered by the King’s master
cook, who stood there with his white apron and
sleeves, and a chopping-knife in his hand, and
challenged their spurs, which were likewise redeemed
with a noble<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c015'><sup>[327]</sup></a> in money, threatening them,
nevertheless, that if they proved not true and loyal
to the King, his lord and master, it must be his
office to hew them from their heels.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>On Monday morning they all met together nigh
at the court, where, in a private room appointed
for them, they were clothed in long robes of purple
satin, with hoods of the same, all lined and edged
about with white taffeta; and thus apparelled, they
gave their attendance upon the Prince at his creation,
and dined that day in his presence, at a side-board,
as is already declared.</p>

which, next to the service of his honour and

takes leave of his lordship for that time; and, till
after the feast at Guildhall, rests from service.
His lordship, accompanied with many noble personages;
the honourable fellowship of ancient magistrates
and aldermen of this city; the two new
sheriffs, the one of his own fraternity (the complete
Brotherhood of Skinners), the right worshipful
master sheriff Dean, a very bountiful and worthy
citizen; not forgetting the noble pains and loves

a second noble volley.</p>

<p class='c026 prose'>Now, that all the honours before mentioned in that

and inquisitive spirit, the names and times
of those kings, queens, prince, dukes, and nobles,
free of the honourable Fraternity of Skinners in
London, shall here receive their proper illustrations.</p>

<p class='c026 prose'>Anno 1329. King Edward the Third, Plantagenet,
by whom, in the first of his reign, this worthy
Society of Skinners was incorporate, he their first
royal founder and brother: queen Philip his wife,
younger daughter of William Earl of Henault, the
first royal sister; so gloriously virtuous that she is
a rich ornament to memory; she both founded and
endowed Queen’s College in Oxford, to the continuing
estate of which I myself wish all happiness;
this queen at her death desired three courtesies,
some of which are rare in these days; first, that
her debts might be paid to the merchants; secondly,
that her gifts to the church might be performed;
thirdly, that the king, when he died, would at Westminster
be interred with her.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Anno 1357. Edward Plantagenet, surnamed the
Black Prince, son to Edward the Third, Prince of
Wales, Duke of Guienne, Aquitaine, and Cornwall,
Earl Palatine of Chester. In the battle of Poictiers
in France, he, with 8000 English against 60,000
French, got the victory; took the king, Philip his
son, seventeen earls, with divers other noble personages,
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>King Richard the Second, Plantagenet. This
king being the third royal brother of this honourable
Company, and at that time the Society consisting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>of two brotherhoods of Corpus Christi, the
one at St. Mary Spittle, the other at St. Mary Bethlem
without Bishopsgate, in the eighteenth of his
reign granted them to make their two brotherhoods
one, by the name of the Fraternity of Corpus
Christi of Skinners, which worthy title shines at
this day gloriously amongst ’em; and toward the
end of this king’s reign, 1396, a great feast was
celebrated in Westminster Hall, where the lord
mayor of this city sate as guest.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Anno 1381. Queen Anne, his wife, daughter to
the Emperor Charles the Fourth, and sister to
[the] Emperor Wenceslaus, whose modesty then
may make this age blush now, she being the first
that taught women to ride sideling on horseback;
but who it was that taught ’em to ride straddling,
there is no records so immodest that can shew
me, only the impudent time and the open profession.
This fair precedent of womanhood died at
Sheen, now Richmond; for grief whereof King
Richard her lord abandoned and defaced that goodly
house.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Anno 1399. King Henry the Fourth, Plantagenet,
surnamed Bolingbroke, a fourth royal brother. In
his time the famous Guildhall in London was erected,
where the honourable courts of the city are kept,
and this bounteous feast yearly celebrated. In the
twelfth year of his reign the river of Thames flowed
thrice in one day.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Queen Joan, or Jane, Duchess of Bretagne, late
wife to John Duke of Bretagne, and daughter to the
King of Navarre, another princely sister.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Anno 1412. King Henry the Fifth, Plantagenet,
Prince of Wales, proclaimed Mayor and Regent of
France: he won that famous victory on the French
at the battle of Agincourt.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Queen Catherine, his wife, daughter to Charles
the Sixth, King of France.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>King Henry the Sixth, Plantagenet, of the house
of Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>King Edward the Fourth, Plantagenet, of the
house of York. This king feasted the lord mayor,
Richard Chawry, and the aldermen his brethren,
with certain commoners, in Waltham Forest: after
dinner rode a-hunting with the king, who gave him
plenty of venison, and sent to the lady mayoress
and her sisters the aldermen’s wives, two harts, six
bucks, and a tun of wine, to make merry; and this
noble feast was kept at Drapers’ Hall.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Anno 1463. Queen Elizabeth Grey, his wife,
daughter to Richard Woodville, Earl Rivers, and
to the Duchess of Bedford; she was mother to the
Lord Grey of Ruthin, that in his time was Marquis
Dorset.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>King Richard the Third, brother to Edward the
Fourth, Duke of Gloucester, and of the house of
York.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Thomas Plantagenet, second son of Henry the
Fourth.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>John Plantagenet, third son of Henry the Fourth;
so noble a soldier, and so great a terror to the
French, that when Charles the Eighth was moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>to deface his monument—being buried in Rouen—the
king thus answered,—“Pray, let him rest in
peace being dead, of whom we were all afraid when
he lived.”</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Humfrey Plantagenet, fourth son of Henry the
Fourth.</p>

<p class='c026 prose'>The feast ended at Guildhall, his lordship, as
yearly custom invites it, goes, accompanied with
the Triumph before him, towards St. Paul’s, to
perform the noble and reverend ceremonies which
divine antiquity religiously ordained, and are<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c015'><sup>[338]</sup></a> no
less than faithfully observed. Holy service and
ceremonies accomplished, his lordship returns by
torchlight to his own house, the whole Triumph
placed in comely and decent order before him; the
Wilderness; the Sanctuary of Fame, adorned with
lights; the Parliament of Honour; and the Triumphant

<p class='c023 prose'>Passing from this, and more to encourage the
labour of the magistrate, he is now conducted to
the master Triumph, called the Tower of Virtue,
which for the strength, safety, and perpetuity, bears
the name of the Brazen Tower; of which Integrity
keeps the keys, virtue being indeed as a brazen
wall to a city or commonwealth; and to illustrate
the prosperity it brings to a kingdom, the top turrets
or pinnacles of this Brazen Tower shine bright
like gold; and upon the gilded battlements thereof
stand six knights, three in silvered and three in gilt
armour, as Virtue’s standard-bearers or champions,
holding six little streamers or silver bannerets, in
each of which are displayed the arms of a noble
brother and benefactor, Fame sounding forth their
praises to the world, for the encouragement of after-ages,
and Antiquity, the register of Fame, containing
in her golden legend their names and titles;
as that of Sir Henry Fitz-Alwin, draper, lord mayor
four-and-twenty years together; Sir John Norman,
the first that was rowed in barge to Westminster
with silver oars, at his own cost and charges; Sir
Francis Drake, the son of Fame, who in two years
and ten months did cast a girdle about the world;
the unparalleled Sir Simon Eyre, who built Leadenhall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>at his own cost, a store-house for the poor,
both in the upper lofts and lower; the generous
and memorable Sir Richard Champion and Sir John
Milborne, two bountiful benefactors; Sir Richard
Hardell, in the seat of magistracy six years together;
Sir John Poultney, four years, which Sir
John founded a college in the parish of St. Lawrence
Poultney, by Candlewick Street; John Hinde,
a re-edifier of the parish church of St. Swithin by
London Stone; Sir Richard Pipe, who being free
of the Leather-sellers, was also from them translated
to the ancient and honourable Society of Drapers;
and many whose names, for brevity’s cause, I must
omit, and hasten to the honour and service of the
time present. From the tower, Fame, a personage
properly adorned, thus salutes the great master of
the day and triumph:</p>

adorned with the lively figures of all those graces

of so high an office; as Justice, Sincerity, Meekness,
Wisdom, Providence, Equality, Industry,
Truth, Peace, Patience, Hope, Harmony, all illustrated
by proper emblems and expressions; as,
Justice by a sword; Sincerity by a lamb; Meekness

which, that it may now appear no less heightened

progress through the city: the first for the land,
attending his most wished arrival in Paul’s-Churchyard,
which bears the inscription of a Mount Royal,
on which mount are placed certain kings and great
commanders, which ancient history produces, that
were originally sprung from shepherds and humble
beginnings: only the number of six presented;
some with crowns, some with gilt laurels, holding
in their hands silver sheep-hooks; viz. Viriat, a
prime commander of the Portugals—renowned
amongst the historians, especially the Romans—who,
in battles of fourteen years’ continuance, purchased
many great and honourable victories; Arsaces,
king of the Parthians, who ordained the first
kingdom that ever was amongst them, and in the
reverence of this king’s name and memory all others
his successors were called Arsacides after his name,
as the Roman emperors took the name of Cæsar
for the love of great Cæsar Augustus; also Marcus
Julius Lucinus; Bohemia’s Primislaus; the emperor
Pertinax; the great victor Tamburlain, conqueror
of Syria, Armenia, Babylon, Mesopotamia, Scythia,
Albania, &#38;c. Many honourable worthies more I

London by Thomas Creede, for Thomas Bushell, and are to be
sold at his shop at the North doore of Paules Church.</i> 1599. 8vo.</p>

<p class='c060'>“In 1599,” says Warton, “appeared ‘<span class='sc'>Micro-cynicon</span> sixe
snarling satyres by T. M. Gentleman,’ perhaps Thomas Middleton.”
<i>Hist. of English Poetry</i>, vol. iv. p. 70, ed. 4to.</p>

Envy,”—</p>

      <div class='line'>He more defies thy hate, thy hunt, thy haunt,”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025 prose0'>and because that “Defiance” is followed by what bears expressly
the title of “The Author’s Prologue,” Mr. J. P. Collier
suspects that T. M. was only the author’s friend: see <i>The
Poetical Decameron</i>, where these satires are noticed at considerable
length, vol. i. p. 282, sqq.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>That T. M. and the author of <i>Micro-cynicon</i> were the same
person, I have very little doubt; but that he was Thomas
Middleton, I feel by no means confident.</p>

<p class='c061'>To all those that are truly virtuous, and can touch
pitch and yet never defile themselves; read the
mischievous lives and pernicious practices of villains,
and yet be never the worse at the end of the
book, but rather confirmed the more in their honest
estates and the uprightness of their virtues;—to
such I dedicate myself, the wholesome intent of my
labours, the modesty of my phrases, that even blush
when they discover vices and unmask the world’s
shadowed villanies: and I account him as a traitor
to virtue, who, diving into the deep of this cunning
age, and finding there such monsters of nature,
such speckled lumps of poison as panders, harlots,
and ruffians do figure, if he rise up silent again,
and neither discover or publish them to the civil
rank of sober and continent livers, who thereby
may shun those two devouring gulfs, to wit, of
deceit and luxury,<a id='r573'></a><a href='#f573' class='c015'><sup>[573]</sup></a> which swallow up more mortals
than Scylla and Charybdis, those two cormorants
and Woolners<a id='r574'></a><a href='#f574' class='c015'><sup>[574]</sup></a> of the sea, one tearing, the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>devouring. Wherefore I freely persuade myself, no
virtuous spirit or judicial worthy but will approve
my politic moral, where, under the shadow of the
devil’s legacies, or his bequeathing to villains, I
strip their villanies naked, and bare the infectious
bulks<a id='r575'></a><a href='#f575' class='c015'><sup>[575]</sup></a> of craft, cozenage, and panderism, the three
bloodhounds of a commonwealth. And thus far I
presume that none will or can except at this—which
I call the Black Book, because it doubly
damns the devil—but some tainted harlot, noseless
bawd, obscene ruffian, and such of the same black
nature and filthy condition, that poison the towardly
spring of gentility, and corrupt with the mud of
mischiefs the pure and clear streams of a kingdom.
And to spurgall such, who reads me shall know I
dare; for I fear neither the ratsbane of a harlot
nor the poniard of a villain.</p>

<p class='c026 prose'>No sooner was <i>Pierce Pennyless</i> breathed forth,
but I, the light-burning sergeant, Lucifer, quenched
my fiery shape, and whipt into a constable’s night-gown,
the cunningest habit that could be, to search
tipsy taverns, roosting inns, and frothy alehouses;
when calling together my worshipful bench of bill-men,<a id='r584'></a><a href='#f584' class='c015'><sup>[584]</sup></a>
I proceeded toward Pict-hatch, intending to
begin there first, which (as I may fitly name it) is the
very skirts of all brothel-houses. The watchmen,
poor night-crows, followed, and thought still they
had had the constable by the hand, when they had
the devil by the gown-sleeve. At last, I looking
up to the casements of every suspected mansion,
and spying a light twinkling between hope and
desperation, guessed it to be some sleepy snuff, ever
and anon winking and nodding in the socket of a
candlestick, as if the flame had been a-departing
from the greasy body of Simon Snuff the stinkard.
Whereupon I, the black constable, commanded my
white guard not only to assist my office with their
brown bills, but to raise up the house extempory:
with that, the dreadful watchmen, having authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>standing by them, thundered at the door, whilst the
candle lightened in the chamber; and so between
thundering and lightening, the bawd risse,<a id='r585'></a><a href='#f585' class='c015'><sup>[585]</sup></a> first
putting the snuff to an untimely death, a cruel and
a lamentable murder, and then, with her fat-sagg
chin<a id='r586'></a><a href='#f586' class='c015'><sup>[586]</sup></a> hanging down like a cow’s udder, lay reeking
out at the window, demanding the reason why they
did summon a parley. I told her in plain terms
that I had a warrant to search from the sheriff of
Limbo.<a id='r587'></a><a href='#f587' class='c015'><sup>[587]</sup></a> How? from the sheriff of Lime-street?
replied mistress wimble-chin (for so she understood
the word Limbo, as if Limbo had been Latin for
Lime-street); why then all the doors of my house
shall fly open and receive you, master constable.
With that, as being the watchword, two or three
vaulted out of their beds at once, one swearing,
stocks and stones, he could not find his stockings,
other that they could not hit upon their false
bodies, when to speak troth and shame myself,
they were then as close to their flesh as they could,
and never put them off since they were twelve year
old. At last they shuffled up, and were shut out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>at the back part, as I came in at the north part.
Up the stairs I went to examine the feather-beds,
and carry the sheets before the justice, for there
was none else then to carry; only the floor was
strewed with busk-points,<a id='r588'></a><a href='#f588' class='c015'><sup>[588]</sup></a> silk garters, and shoe-strings,
scattered here and there for haste to make
away from me, and the farther such run, the nearer
they come to me. Then another door opening
rearward, there came puffing out of the next room
a villanous lieutenant without a band, as if he had
been new cut down, like one at Wapping, with his
cruel garters<a id='r589'></a><a href='#f589' class='c015'><sup>[589]</sup></a> about his neck, which fitly resembled
two of Derrick’s necklaces.<a id='r590'></a><a href='#f590' class='c015'><sup>[590]</sup></a> He had a head of
hair like one of my devils in <i>Doctor Faustus</i>,<a id='r591'></a><a href='#f591' class='c015'><sup>[591]</sup></a> when
the old theatre cracked and frighted the audience:
his brow was made of coarse bran, as if all the
flour had been bolted out to make honester men,
so ruggedly moulded with chaps and crevices, that
I wonder how it held together, had it not been
pasted with villany: his eyebrows jetted out like
the round casement of an alderman’s dining-room,
which made his eyes look as if they had been both
dammed in his head; for if so be two souls had
been so far sunk into hell-pits, they would never
have walked abroad again: his nostrils were cousin-germans
to coral, though of a softer condition and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>of a more relenting humour: his crow-black muchatoes<a id='r592'></a><a href='#f592' class='c015'><sup>[592]</sup></a>
were almost half an ell from one end to
the other, as though they would whisper him in
the ear about a cheat or a murder; and his whole
face in general was more detestable ugly than the
visage of my grim porter Cerberus, which shewed
that all his body besides was made of filthy dust
and sea-coal ashes: a down countenance he had,
as if he would have looked thirty mile into hell,
and seen Sisyphus rolling, and Ixion spinning and
reeling. Thus in a pair of hoary slippers, his
stockings dangling about his wrists, and his red
buttons like foxes out of their holes, he began, like
the true champion of a vaulting-house,<a id='r593'></a><a href='#f593' class='c015'><sup>[593]</sup></a> first to
fray me with the bugbears of his rough-cast beard,
and then to sound base in mine ears like the bear-garden
drum; and this was the humour he put on,
and the very apparel of his phrases: Why, master
constable, dare you balk us in our own mansion,
ha? What! is not our house our Cole-harbour,<a id='r594'></a><a href='#f594' class='c015'><sup>[594]</sup></a>
our castle of come-down and lie-down? Must my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>honest wedded punk here, my glory-fat Audrey,<a id='r595'></a><a href='#f595' class='c015'><sup>[595]</sup></a>
be taken napping, and raised up by the thunder of
bill-men?<a id='r596'></a><a href='#f596' class='c015'><sup>[596]</sup></a> Are we disannulled of our first sleep,
and cheated of our dreams and fantasies? Is there
not law too for stealing away a man’s slumbers, as
well as for sheets off from hedges? Come you to
search an honest bawdy-house, this seven and
twenty years in fame and shame? Go to, then, you
shall search, nay, my very boots too; are you
well now? the least hole in my house<a id='r597'></a><a href='#f597' class='c015'><sup>[597]</sup></a> too; are you
pleased now? Can we not take our ease in our
inn,<a id='r598'></a><a href='#f598' class='c015'><sup>[598]</sup></a> but we must come out so quickly? Naud,<a id='r599'></a><a href='#f599' class='c015'><sup>[599]</sup></a>
go to bed, sweet Naud; thou wilt cool thy grease
anon, and make thy fat cake. This said, by the
virtue and vice of my office I commanded my bill-men
down stairs; when in a twinkling discovering
myself a little, as much as might serve to relish
me, and shew what stuff I was made of, I came
and kissed the bawd, hugged her excellent villanies
and cunning rare conveyances;<a id='r600'></a><a href='#f600' class='c015'><sup>[600]</sup></a> then turning
myself, I threw mine arms, like a scarf or bandileer,<a id='r601'></a><a href='#f601' class='c015'><sup>[601]</sup></a>
cross the lieutenant’s melancholy bosom, embraced
his resolute phrases and his dissolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>humours, highly commending the damnable trade
and detestable course of their living, so excellent-filthy
and so admirable-villanous. Whereupon
this lieutenant of Pict-hatch<a id='r602'></a><a href='#f602' class='c015'><sup>[602]</sup></a> fell into deeper league
and farther acquaintance with the blackness of my
bosom, sometimes calling me master Lucifer the
head-borough, sometimes master Devillin the little
black constable. Then telling me he heard from
Limbo<a id='r603'></a><a href='#f603' class='c015'><sup>[603]</sup></a> the second of the last month, and that he had
the letter to shew, where they were all very merry;
marry, as he told me, there were some of his friends
in Phlegethon troubled with the heart-burning; yea,
and with the soul-burning too, thought I, though
thou little dreamest of the torment: then complaining
to me of their bad takings all the last
plaguy summer,<a id='r604'></a><a href='#f604' class='c015'><sup>[604]</sup></a> that there was no stirrings, and
therefore undone for want of doings: whereupon,
after many such inductions to bring the scene of
his poverty upon the stage, he desired, in cool
terms, to borrow some forty pence of me. I, stuft
with anger at that base and lazy petition, knowing
that a right true villain and an absolute practised
pander could not want silver damnation, but, living
upon the revenues of his wits, might purchase the
devil and all, half-conquered with rage, thus I replied
to his baseness: Why, for shame! a bawd
and poor? why, then, let usurers go a-begging, or,
like an old Greek, stand in Paul’s with a porringer;
let brokers become whole honest then, and remove
to heaven out of Houndsditch; lawyers turn feeless,
and take ten of a poor widow’s tears for ten shillings;
merchants never forswear themselves, whose
great perjured oaths a’ land turn to great winds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>and cast away their ships at sea, which false perfidious
tempest splits their ships abroad and their
souls at home, making the one take salt water and
the other salt fire; let mercers then have conscionable
thumbs when they measure out that smooth
glittering devil, satin, and that old reveller, velvet,
in the days of Monsieur,<a id='r605'></a><a href='#f605' class='c015'><sup>[605]</sup></a> both which have devoured
many an honest field of wheat and barley, that
hath been metamorphosed and changed into white
money. Pooh, these are but little wonders, and
may be easily possible in the working. A usurer to
cry bread and meat is not a thing impossible; for
indeed your greatest usurer is your greatest beggar,
wanting as well that which he hath as that which
he hath not; then who can be a greater beggar?
He will not have his house smell like a cook’s
shop, and therefore takes an order no meat shall
be dressed in it: and because there was an house
upon Fish-street-hill burnt to the ground once, he
can abide by no means to have a fire in his chimney
ever since. To the confirming of which I will insert
here a pretty conceit<a id='r606'></a><a href='#f606' class='c015'><sup>[606]</sup></a> of a nimble-witted gentlewoman,
that was worthy to be ladified for the jest;
who, entering into a usurer’s house in London to
take up money upon unmerciful interest for the
space of a twelvemonth, was conducted through
two or three hungry rooms into a fair dining-room
by a lenten-faced fellow, the usurer’s man, whose
nose shewed as if it had been made of hollow pasteboard,
and his cheeks like two thin pancakes clapt
together; a pitiful knave he was, and looked for
all the world as if meal had been at twenty shillings
a bushel. The gentlewoman being placed in this
fair room to await the usurer’s leisure, who was
casting up ditches of gold in his counting-house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>and being almost frozen with standing—for it was
before Candlemas’ frost-bitten term—ever and
anon turning about to the chimney, where she saw
a pair of corpulent, gigantical andirons, that stood
like two burgomasters, at both corners, a hearth
briskly dressed up, and a great cluster of charcoal
piled up together like black puddings, which lay
for a dead fire, and in the dining-room too: the
gentlewoman, wondering it was so long a-kindling, at
last she caught the miserable conceit of it, and
calling her man to her, bade him seek out for a
piece of chalk, or some peeling of a white wall,
whilst in the meantime she conceited the device;
when, taking up the six former<a id='r607'></a><a href='#f607' class='c015'><sup>[607]</sup></a> coals, one after
another, she chalked upon each of them a satirical
letter; which six were these,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>T. D. C. R. U. S.;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025 prose0'>explained thus,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>These dead coals</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Resemble usurers’ souls.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023 prose'>Then placing them in the same order again, turning
the chalked sides inward to try conclusions,<a id='r608'></a><a href='#f608' class='c015'><sup>[608]</sup></a> which,
as it happened, made up the jest the better: by
that time the usurer had done amongst his golden
heaps, and entertaining the gentlewoman with a
cough a quarter of an hour long, at last, after a
rotten hawk and a hem, he began to spit and speak
to her. To conclude; she was furnished of the
money for a twelvemonth, but upon large security
and most tragical usury. When, keeping her day
the twelvemonth after, coming to repay both the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>money and the breed of it—for interest may well
be called the usurer’s bastard—she found the hearth
dressed up in the same order, with a dead fire of charcoal
again, and yet the Thames was half-frozen at
that time with the bitterness of the season: when
turning the foremost rank of coals, determining
again, as it seemed, to draw some pretty knavery
upon them too, she spied all those six letters which
she chalked upon them the twelvemonth before,
and never a one stirred or displaced; the strange
sight of which made her break into these words:—Is
it possible, quoth she, a usurer should burn so
little here, and so much in hell? or is it the cold
property of these coals to be above a twelvemonth
a-kindling? So much to shew the frozen charity
of a usurer’s chimney.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>And then a broker to be an honest soul, that is,
to take but sixpence a-month, and threepence for
the bill-making; a devil of a very good conscience!
Possible too to have a lawyer bribeless and without
fee, if his clientess, or female client, please his eye
well: a merchant to wear a suit of perjury but
once a quarter or so,—mistake me not, I mean not
four times an hour; that shift were too short, he
could not put it on so soon, I think: and, lastly,
not impossible for a mercer to have a thumb in
folio, like one of the biggest of the guard, and so
give good and very bountiful measure. But, which
is most impossible, to be a right bawd and poor—it
strikes my spleen into dulness, and turns all my
blood into cool lead. Wherefore was vice ordained
but to be rich, shining, and wealthy, seeing virtue,
her opponent, is poor, ragged, and needy? Those
that are poor are timorous-honest and foolish-harmless;
as your carolling shepherds, whistling
ploughmen, and such of the same innocent rank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>that never relish the black juice of villany, never
taste the red food of murder, or the damnable
suckets of luxury:<a id='r609'></a><a href='#f609' class='c015'><sup>[609]</sup></a> whereas a pander is the very
oil of villains and the syrup of rogues; of excellent
rogues, I mean, such as have purchased five hundreds
a-year by the talent of their villany. How
many such gallants do I know, that live only upon
the revenue of their wits! some whose brains are
above an hundred mile about; and those are your
geometrical thieves, which may fitly be called so,
because they measure the highways with false gallops,
and therefore are heirs of more acres than
five-and-fifty elder brothers: sometimes they are
clerks of Newmarket Heath, sometimes the sheriffs
of Salisbury Plain; and another time they commit
brothelry, when they make many a man stand at
Hockley-in-the-Hole. These are your great head
landlords indeed, which call the word <i>robbing</i> the
gathering in of their rents, and name all passengers
their tenants-at-will.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Another set of delicate knaves there are, that
dive into deeds and writings of lands left to young
gullfinches, poisoning the true sense and intent of
them with the merciless antimony of the Common
Law, <a id='r610'></a><a href='#f610' class='c015'><sup>[610]</sup></a> and so by some crafty clau[s]e or two shove
the true foolish owners quite beside the saddle of
their patrimonies, and then they hang only by the
stirrups, that is, by the cold alms and frozen charity
of the gentlemen-defeaters, who—if they take after
me, their great grandfather—will rather stamp them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>down in the deep mire of poverty than bolster up
their heads with a poor wisp of charity. Such as
these corrupt the true meanings of last wills and
testaments, and turn legacies the wrong way, wresting
them quite awry, like Grantham steeple.<a id='r611'></a><a href='#f611' class='c015'><sup>[611]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The third rank, quainter than the former, presents
us with the race of lusty vaulting gallants,
that, instead of a French horse, practise upon their
mistresses all the nimble tricks of vaulting, and are
worthy to be made dukes for doing the somerset
so lively. This nest of gallants, for the natural
parts that are in them, are maintained by their
drawn-work dames and their embroidered mistresses,
and can dispend their two thousand a-year
out of other men’s coffers; keep at every heel a man,

and an English page, which fills up the place of an
ingle:<a id='r612'></a><a href='#f612' class='c015'><sup>[612]</sup></a> they have their city-horse, which I may
well term their stone-horse, or their horse upon
the stones; for indeed the city being the lusty
dame and mistress of the land, lays all her foundation
upon good stone-work, and somebody pays
well for’t where’er it lights, and might with less
cost keep London Bridge in reparations every fall

Silverpin’s, the only door-keeper<a id='r621'></a><a href='#f621' class='c015'><sup>[621]</sup></a> in Europe: why,
we meet one another every term-time, and shake
hands when the Exchequer opens; but when we
open our hands, the devil of penny we can see.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>With that I cheered up the drooping slave with
the aqua-vitæ<a id='r622'></a><a href='#f622' class='c015'><sup>[622]</sup></a> of villany, and put him in excellent
comfort of my damnable legacy; saying I
would stuff him with so many wealthy instructions
that he should excel even Pandarus himself, and
go nine mile beyond him in pandarism, and from
thenceforward he should never know a true rascal
go under his red velvet slops,<a id='r623'></a><a href='#f623' class='c015'><sup>[623]</sup></a> and a gallant bawd
indeed below her loose-bodied<a id='r624'></a><a href='#f624' class='c015'><sup>[624]</sup></a> satin.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>This said, the slave hugged himself, and bussed
the bawd for joy: when presently I left them in the
midst of their wicked smack, and descended to my
bill-men<a id='r625'></a><a href='#f625' class='c015'><sup>[625]</sup></a> that waited in the pernicious alley for
me, their master constable. And marching forward
to the third garden-house, there we knocked up
the ghost of mistress Silverpin, who suddenly risse<a id='r626'></a><a href='#f626' class='c015'><sup>[626]</sup></a>
out of two white sheets, and acted out of her tiring-house<a id='r627'></a><a href='#f627' class='c015'><sup>[627]</sup></a>
window: but having understood who we
were, and the authority of our office, she presently,
even in her ghost’s apparel, unfolded the doors
and gave me my free entrance; when in policy I
charged the rest to stay and watch the house below,
whilst I stumbled up two pair of stairs in the dark,
but at last caught in mine eyes the sullen blaze of
a melancholy lamp that burnt very tragically upon
the narrow desk of a half bedstead, which descried<a id='r628'></a><a href='#f628' class='c015'><sup>[628]</sup></a>
all the pitiful ruins throughout the whole chamber.
The bare privities of the stone-walls were hid with
two pieces of painted cloth,<a id='r629'></a><a href='#f629' class='c015'><sup>[629]</sup></a> but so ragged and
tottered,<a id='r630'></a><a href='#f630' class='c015'><sup>[630]</sup></a> that one might have seen all nevertheless,
hanging for all the world like the two men in chains
between Mile-end and Hackney. The testern, or
the shadow over the bed, was made of four ells of
cobwebs, and a number of small spinner’s-ropes
hung down for curtains: the spindle-shank spiders,
which shew like great lechers with little legs, went
stalking over his head as if they had been conning
of <i>Tamburlaine</i>.<a id='r631'></a><a href='#f631' class='c015'><sup>[631]</sup></a> To conclude, there was many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>such sights to be seen, and all under a penny,
beside the lamentable prospect of his hose<a id='r632'></a><a href='#f632' class='c015'><sup>[632]</sup></a> and
doublet, which, being of old Kendal-green, fitly
resembled a pitched field, upon which trampled
many a lusty corporal. In this unfortunate tiring-house
lay poor Pierce upon a pillow stuffed with
horse-meat; the sheets smudged so dirtily, as if
they had been stolen by night out of Saint Pulcher’s<a id='r633'></a><a href='#f633' class='c015'><sup>[633]</sup></a>
churchyard when the sexton had left a
grave open, and so laid the dead bodies wool-ward:<a id='r634'></a><a href='#f634' class='c015'><sup>[634]</sup></a>
the coverlet was made of pieces a’ black cloth
clapt together, such as was snatched off the rails
in King’s-street at the queen’s funeral. Upon this
miserable bed’s-head lay the old copy of his <i>Supplication</i>,
in foul-written hand, which my black
Knight of the Post conveyed to hell; which no
sooner I entertained in my hand, but with the rattling
and blabbing of the papers poor Pierce began
to stretch and grate his nose against the hard pillow;
when after a rouse or two, he muttered these
reeling words between drunk and sober, that is,
between sleeping and waking:—I should laugh,
i’faith, if for all this I should prove a usurer before
I die, and have never a penny now to set up withal.
I would build a nunnery in Pict-hatch<a id='r635'></a><a href='#f635' class='c015'><sup>[635]</sup></a> here, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>turn the walk in Paul’s<a id='r636'></a><a href='#f636' class='c015'><sup>[636]</sup></a> into a bowling alley: I
would have the Thames leaded over, that they
might play at cony-holes with the arches under
London Bridge. Well (and with that he waked),
the devil is mad knave still.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>How now, Pierce? quoth I, dost thou call me
knave to my face? Whereat the poor slave started
up with his hair a-tiptoe; to whom by easy degrees
I gently discovered myself; who, trembling like the
treble of a lute under the heavy finger of a farmer’s
daughter, craved pardon of my damnable excellence,
and gave me my titles as freely as if he had
known where all my lordships lay, and how many
acres there were in Tartary.<a id='r637'></a><a href='#f637' class='c015'><sup>[637]</sup></a> But at the length,
having recovered to be bold again, he unfolded all
his bosom to me; told me that the Knight of Perjury
had lately brought him a singed letter sent
from a damned friend of his, which was thus
directed as followeth,</p>

<p class='c026 prose'>After I saw poor Pennyless grow so well acquainted
with me, and so familiar with the villany of my humour,
I unlocked my determinations, and laid open
my intents; in particular<a id='r638'></a><a href='#f638' class='c015'><sup>[638]</sup></a> the cause of my uprising,
being moved both with his penetrable petition and
his insufferable poverty, and therefore changed my
shape into a little wapper-eyed<a id='r639'></a><a href='#f639' class='c015'><sup>[639]</sup></a> constable, to wink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>and blink at small faults, and through the policy
of searching, to find him out the better in his cleanly
tabernacle; and therefore gave him encouragement
now to be frolic, for the time was at hand, like a
pickpurse, that Pierce should be called no more
Pennyless, like the Mayor’s bench at Oxford,<a id='r640'></a><a href='#f640' class='c015'><sup>[640]</sup></a> but
rather Pierce Pennyfist, because his palm shall be
pawed with pence. This said, I bade him be
resolved and get up to breakfast, whilst I went to
gather my noise<a id='r641'></a><a href='#f641' class='c015'><sup>[641]</sup></a> of villains together, and made his
lodging my convocation-house. With that, in a
resulting humour, he called his hose<a id='r642'></a><a href='#f642' class='c015'><sup>[642]</sup></a> and doublet
to him (which could almost go alone, borne like a
hearse upon the legs of vermin), whilst I thumped
down stairs with my cow-heel, embraced mistress
Silverpin, and betook me to my bill-men;<a id='r643'></a><a href='#f643' class='c015'><sup>[643]</sup></a> when,
in a twinkling, before them all, I leapt out of master
constable’s night-gown into an usurer’s fusty furred
jacket; whereat the watchmen staggered, and all
their bills fell down in a swoon; when I walked
close by them, laughing and coughing like a rotten-lunged
usurer, to see what Italian faces they all
made when they missed their constable, and saw
the black gown of his office lie full in a puddle.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Well, away I scudded in the musty moth-eaten
habit; and being upon Exchange-time, I crowded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>myself amongst merchants, poisoned all the Burse<a id='r644'></a><a href='#f644' class='c015'><sup>[644]</sup></a>
in a minute, and turned their faiths and troths into
curds and whey, making them swear that things
now which they forswore when the quarters struck
again; for I was present at the clapping up of
every bargain, which did ne’er hold, no longer than
they held hands together. There I heard news out
of all countries, in all languages; how many villains<a id='r645'></a><a href='#f645' class='c015'><sup>[645]</sup></a>
were in Spain, how many luxurs<a id='r646'></a><a href='#f646' class='c015'><sup>[646]</sup></a> in Italy,
how many perjurds in France, and how many reel-pots
in Germany. At last I met, at half-turn, one
whom I had spent mine eyes so long for, an hoary
money-master, that had been off and on some six-and-fifty
years damned in his counting-house, for
his only recreation was but to hop about the Burse
before twelve, to hear what news from the Bank,
and how many merchants were banqrout<a id='r647'></a><a href='#f647' class='c015'><sup>[647]</sup></a> the last
change of the moon. This rammish penny-father<a id='r648'></a><a href='#f648' class='c015'><sup>[648]</sup></a>
I rounded<a id='r649'></a><a href='#f649' class='c015'><sup>[649]</sup></a> in the left ear, winded in my intent, the

smiled upon me in French, and replied,—</p>

</div>

<p class='c025 prose0'>With that we shook hands, and, as we parted, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>bade him bring master Cog-bill the scrivener along
with him; and so I vanished out of that dressing.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>And passing through Birchin-lane, amidst a camp-royal
of hose and doublets (master Snip’s backside
being turned where his face stood), I took excellent
occasion to slip into a captain’s suit, a valiant buff
doublet, stuffed with points<a id='r650'></a><a href='#f650' class='c015'><sup>[650]</sup></a> like a leg of mutton
with parsley, and a pair of velvet slops<a id='r651'></a><a href='#f651' class='c015'><sup>[651]</sup></a> scored
thick with lace, which ran round about the hose
like ringworms, able to make a man scratch where
it itched not. And thus accoutred, taking up my
weapons a’ trust in the same order at the next
cutler’s I came to, I marched to master Bezle’s
ordinary, where I found a whole dozen of my
damned crew, sweating as much at dice as many
poor labourers do with the casting of ditches; when
presently I set in a stake amongst them: round it
went; <a id='line.531.18'></a>but the crafty dice having peeped upon me
once, knew who I was well enough, and would
never have their little black eyes off a’ me all the
while after. At last came my turn about, the dice
quaking in my fist before I threw them; but when
I yerked them forth, away they ran like Irish
lacqueys<a id='r652'></a><a href='#f652' class='c015'><sup>[652]</sup></a> as far as their bones would suffer them,
I sweeping up all the stakes that lay upon the
table; whereat some stamped, others swore, the
rest cursed, and all in general fretted to the gall
that a new-comer, as they termed me, should gather
in so many fifteens at the first vomit. Well, thus
it passed on, the dice running as false as the drabs
in Whitefriars; and when any one thought himself
surest, in came I with a lurching cast, and
made them all swear round again; but such
gunpowder oaths they were, that I wonder how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>the ceiling held together without spitting mortar
upon them. Zounds, captain, swore one to me,
I think the devil be thy good lord and master.
True, thought I, and thou his gentleman-usher.
In conclusion, it fatted me better than twenty
eighteenpence ordinaries,<a id='r653'></a><a href='#f653' class='c015'><sup>[653]</sup></a> to hear them rage, curse,
and swear, like so many emperors of darkness.
And all these twelve were of twelve several companies.
There was your gallant extraordinary thief
that keeps his college of good-fellows,<a id='r654'></a><a href='#f654' class='c015'><sup>[654]</sup></a> and will not
fear to rob a lord in his coach for all his ten
trencher-bearers on horseback; your deep-conceited
cutpurse, who by the dexterity of his knife
will draw out the money, and make a flame-coloured
purse shew like the bottomless pit, but with never
a soul in’t; your cheating bowler, that will bank
false of purpose, and lose a game of twelvepence to
purchase his partner twelve shillings in bets, and
so share it after the play; your cheveril-gutted
catchpoll, who like a horse-leech sucks gentlemen;
and, in all, your twelve tribes of villany; who no
sooner understood the quaint form of such an uncustomed
legacy, but they all pawned their vicious
golls<a id='r655'></a><a href='#f655' class='c015'><sup>[655]</sup></a> to meet there at the hour prefixed; and to
confirm their resolution the more, each slipped down
his stocking, baring his right knee, and so began
to drink a health half as deep as mother Hubburd’s
cellar,—she that was called in<a id='r656'></a><a href='#f656' class='c015'><sup>[656]</sup></a> for selling her working
bottle-ale to bookbinders, and spurting the
froth upon courtiers’ noses. To conclude, I was
their only captain (for so they pleased to title me);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>and so they all risse,<a id='r657'></a><a href='#f657' class='c015'><sup>[657]</sup></a> <i>poculis manibusque</i> applauding
my news; then the hour being more than once and
once reiterated, we were all at our hands again,
and so departed.<a id='r658'></a><a href='#f658' class='c015'><sup>[658]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023 prose'>I could tell now that I was in many a second
house in the city and suburbs afterward, where my
entertainment was not barren, nor my welcome
cheap or ordinary; and then how I walked in
Paul’s<a id='r659'></a><a href='#f659' class='c015'><sup>[659]</sup></a> to see fashions, to dive into villanous meetings,
pernicious plots, black humours, and a million
of mischiefs, which are bred in that cathedral womb
and born within less than forty weeks after. But
some may object and say, What, doth the devil
walk in Paul’s then? Why not, sir, as well as a
sergeant, or a ruffian, or a murderer? May not the
devil, I pray you, walk in Paul’s, as well as the
horse<a id='r660'></a><a href='#f660' class='c015'><sup>[660]</sup></a> go a’ top of Paul’s? for I am sure I was not
far from his keeper. Pooh, I doubt, where there is
no doubt; for there is no true critic indeed that
will carp at the devil.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Now the hour posted onward to accomplish the
effects of my desire, to gorge every vice full of
poison, that the soul might burst at the last, and
vomit out herself upon blue cakes of brimstone.
When returning home for the purpose, in my captain’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>apparel of buff and velvet, I struck mine
hostess into admiration at my proper<a id='r661'></a><a href='#f661' class='c015'><sup>[661]</sup></a> appearance,
for my polt-foot<a id='r662'></a><a href='#f662' class='c015'><sup>[662]</sup></a> was helped out with bumbast; a
property which many worldlings use whose toes
are dead and rotten, and therefore so stuff out
their shoes like the corners of woolpacks.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Well, into my tiring-house<a id='r663'></a><a href='#f663' class='c015'><sup>[663]</sup></a> I went, where I had

barn-cracking farmer, but all my striplings of
perdition, my nephews of damnation, my kindred
and alliance of villany and sharking, were ready
before the hour to receive my bottomless blessing.
When entering into a country night-gown, with a

<p class='c023 prose'>As touching my worldly-wicked goods, I give
and bequeath them in most villanous order following:</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>First, I constitute and ordain Lieutenant Prigbeard,
archpander of England, my sole heir of all
such lands, closes, and gaps as lie within the bounds
of my gift; beside, I have certain houses, tenements,
and withdrawing-rooms in Shoreditch, Tunbold-street,<a id='r667'></a><a href='#f667' class='c015'><sup>[667]</sup></a>
Whitefriars, and Westminster, which
I freely give and bequeath to the aforesaid lieutenant
and the base heirs truly begot of his villanous body;
with this proviso, that he sell none of the land
when he lacks money, nor make away any of the
houses, to impair and weaken the stock, no, not
so much as to alter the property of any of them,
which is, to make them honest against their wills,
but to train and muster his wits upon the Mile-end
of his mazzard,<a id='r668'></a><a href='#f668' class='c015'><sup>[668]</sup></a> rather to fortify the territories of
Tunbold-street and enrich the county of Pict-hatch<a id='r669'></a><a href='#f669' class='c015'><sup>[669]</sup></a>
with all his vicious endeavours, golden enticements,
and damnable practices. And, lieutenant,
thou must dive, as thou usest to do, into landed
novices, who have only wit to be lickerish and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>more, that so their tenants, trotting up to London
with their quartridges, they may pay them the rent,
but thou and thy college shall receive the money.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Let no young wriggle-eyed damosel, if her years
have struck twelve once, be left unassaulted, but
it must be thy office to lay hard siege to her honesty,
and to try if the walls of her maidenhead may be

such wenches will bring in more at year’s end than
a hundred acres of the best harrowed land between

the way,—you must never walk without your deuce
or deuce-ace of drabs after your boot-heels; for
when you are abroad, you know not what use you
may have for them. And, lastly, if you be well-feed
by some riotous gallant, you must practise, as
indeed you do, to wind out a wanton velvet-cap
and bodkin from the tangles of her shop, teaching
her—you know how—to cast a cuckold’s mist before
the eyes of her husband, which is, telling him
she must see her cousin new-come to town, or that
she goes to a woman’s labour,<a id='r671'></a><a href='#f671' class='c015'><sup>[671]</sup></a> when thou knowest
well enough she goes to none but her own. And
being set out of the shop, with her man afore her,

instructions, shall turn the honest, simple fellow off
at the next turning, and give him leave to see <i>The
Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>,<a id='r672'></a><a href='#f672' class='c015'><sup>[672]</sup></a> or <i>A Woman killed with

and fifteen-pound reckonings, made up afterwards
with riotous eggs and muscadine. All these
female vomits and adulterous surfeits I give and
bequeath to thee, which I hope thou wilt put in
practice with all expedition after my decease; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>to that end I ordain thee wholly and solely my only
absolute, excellent, villanous heir.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><i>Item</i>, I give and bequeath to you, Gregory Gauntlet,
high thief on horseback, all such sums of money
that are nothing due to you, and to receive them
in, whether the parties be willing to pay you or
no. You need not make many words with them,
but only these two, <i>Stand and deliver!</i> and therefore
a true thief cannot choose but be wise, because
he is a man of so very few words.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>I need not instruct you, I think, Gregory, about
the politic searching of crafty carriers’ packs, or
ripping up the bowels of wide boots and cloak-bags;
I do not doubt but you have already exercised
them all. But one thing I especially charge
you of, the neglect of which makes many of your
religion tender their winepipes at Tyburn at least
three months before their day; that if you chance
to rob a virtuous townsman on horseback, with his
wife upon a pillion behind him, you presently speak
them fair to walk a turn or two at one side, where,
binding them both together, like man and wife, arm
in arm very lovingly, be sure you tie them hard
enough, for fear they break the bonds of matrimony,
which, if it should fall out so, the matter
would lie sore upon your necks the next sessions
after, because your negligent tying was the cause
of that breach between them.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Now, as for your Welsh hue and cry—the only
net to catch thieves in—I know you avoid well
enough, because you can shift both your beards
and your towns well; but for your better disguising

of mine own, one that makes all the false
hairs for my devils, and all the periwigs that are
worn by old courtiers, who take it for a pride in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>their bald days to wear yellow curls on their foreheads,
when one may almost see the sun go to bed
through the chinks of their faces.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Moreover, Gregory, because I know thee toward
enough, and thy arms full of feats, I make thee
keeper of Combe Park,<a id='r675'></a><a href='#f675' class='c015'><sup>[675]</sup></a> sergeant of Salisbury Plain,

call in more wine-suckers, and damn as many gallons

<p class='c023 prose'>Another kind of rest you have, which is called

<p class='c023 prose'>But that which likes<a id='r682'></a><a href='#f682' class='c015'><sup>[682]</sup></a> me beyond measure is the
villanous nature of that arrest which I may fitly

a’ both sides like old Rowse<a id='r683'></a><a href='#f683' class='c015'><sup>[683]</sup></a> in Cornwall, and
receive double fee both from the creditor and the
debtor, swearing by the post of your office to
shoulder-clap the party the first time he lights upon
the lime-twigs of your liberty; when for a little
usurer’s oil you allow him day by day free passage
to walk by the wicked precinct of your noses, and
yet you will pimple your souls with oaths, till you
make them as well-favoured as your faces, and
swear he never came within the verge of your eyelids.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>Nay, more, if the creditor were present to
see him arrested on the one side, and the party
you wot on over the way at the other side, you
have such quaint shifts, pretty hinderances, and
most lawyer-like delays, ere you will set forward,
that in the meantime he may make himself away
in some by-alley, or rush into the bowels of some
tavern or drinking-school; or if neither, you will
find talk with some shark-shift by the way, and
give him the marks of the party, who will presently
start before you, give the debtor intelligence, and so
a rotten fig for the catchpoll! A most witty, smooth,
and damnable conveyance!<a id='r684'></a><a href='#f684' class='c015'><sup>[684]</sup></a> Many such cunning

of his pearl-colour silk stockings, especially when
some six of your black dogs of Newgate<a id='r685'></a><a href='#f685' class='c015'><sup>[685]</sup></a> are upon

you are the nearest kinsman I have), I give and

your stomach quite, and, I fear me, make you kick
up all the rest.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><i>Item</i>, I give and bequeath to you, old Bias, alias

threw it above three yards short out of hand, upon
very set purpose.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Moreover, Humfrey, I give you the lurching of
all young novices, citizens’ sons, and country gentlemen,
that are hooked in by the winning of one
twelvepenny game at first, lost upon policy, to be
cheated of twelve pounds’ worth a’ bets afterward.
And, old Bias, because thou art now and then smelt
out for a cozener, I would have thee sometimes go

<p class='c060'>The first edition of this tract, in which several verses and

Mr. J. P. Collier (<i>Bridgewater-House Catalogue</i>, p. 199) mentions
it as the <i>second</i> edition; but a careful examination of
both the impressions has convinced me that it is the <i>first</i>.</p>

been dedicated to thee since thou wert one and
twenty, and couldst make water upon thine own
lands: but beware, sir, you cannot carry it away so,
I can tell you, for all your copper-gilt spurs and
your brood of feathers; for there are certain line-sharkers
that have coursed the countries to seek
you out already, and they nothing doubt but to find
you here this Candlemas-term; which, if it should
fall out so—as I hope your worship is wiser than
to venture up so soon to the chambers of London—they
have plotted together with the best common
play-plotter in England to arrest you at the Muses’
suit—though they shoot short of them—and to set
one of the sergeants of poetry, or rather the Poultry,<a id='r704'></a><a href='#f704' class='c015'><sup>[704]</sup></a>

their books, and would never return so much as
would pay for the covers, beside the gilding too,
which stands them in somewhat, you know, and a
yard and a quarter of broad sixpenny ribband; the
price of that you are not ignorant of yourself, because
you wear broad shoe-string; and they cannot
be persuaded but that you pull the strings off from
their books, and so maintain your shoes all the
year long; and think, verily, if the book be in folio,
that you take off the parchment, and give it to your
tailor, but save all the gilding together, which may
amount in time to gild you a pair of spurs withal.
Such are the miserable conceits they gather of you,
because you never give the poor Muse-suckers a
penny: wherefore, if I might counsel you, sir, the
next time they came with their gilded dedications,
you should take the books, make your men break
their pates, then give them ten groats a-piece, and
so drive them away.</p>

<hr class='c049'>
<p class='c031'>Shall I tell you what, reader?—but first I should
call you gentle, courteous, and wise; but ’tis no
matter, they’re but foolish words of course, and
better left out than printed; for if you be so, you
need not be called so; and if you be not so, there
were law against me for calling you out of your
names:—by John of Paul’s-churchyard,<a id='r705'></a><a href='#f705' class='c015'><sup>[705]</sup></a> I swear,
and that oath will be taken at any haberdasher’s,

fall into the hands of a true-spelling printer, and
an honest-minded<a id='r706'></a><a href='#f706' class='c015'><sup>[706]</sup></a> bookseller; and if honesty could
be sold by the bushel like oysters, I had rather have

<p class='c023 prose'>Why I call these <i>Father Hubburd’s Tales</i>, is not
to have them called in again, as the <i>Tale of Mother
Hubburd</i>:<a id='r708'></a><a href='#f708' class='c015'><sup>[708]</sup></a> the world would shew little judgment

what is mirth in me, is as harmless as the quarter-jacks

<p class='c026 prose'>I was sometimes, most chaste lady Nightingale,
or rather, queen Philomel the ravished, a brow-melting
husbandman: to be man and husband is
to be a poor master of many rich cares, which, if he
cannot subject and keep under, he must look for
ever to undergo as many miseries as the hours of
his years contain minutes: such a man I was, and
such a husband, for I was linked in marriage: my
havings were<a id='r731'></a><a href='#f731' class='c015'><sup>[731]</sup></a> small and my means less, yet charge
came on me ere I knew how to keep it; yet did I
all my endeavours, had a plough and land to employ
it, fertile enough if it were manured, and for
tillage I was never held a truant.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>But my destruction, and the ruin of all painful
husbandmen about me, began by the prodigal downfal
of my young landlord, whose father, grandfather,
and great-grandfather, for many generations had
been lords of the town wherein I dwelt, and many
other towns near adjoining: to all which belonged
fair commons for the comfort of the poor, liberty
of fishing, help of fuel by brush and underwood
never denied, till the old devourer of virtue, honesty,
and good neighbourhood, death, had made
our landlord dance after his pipe,—which is so
common, that every one knows the way, though
they make small account of it. Well, die he did;
and as soon as he was laid in his grave, the bell
might well have tolled for hospitality and good
housekeeping; for whether they fell sick with him
and died, and so were buried, I know not; but I
am sure in our town they were never seen since,
nor, that I can hear of, in any other part; especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>about us they are impossible to be found.
Well, our landlord being dead, we had his heir,
gentle enough and fair-conditioned,<a id='r732'></a><a href='#f732' class='c015'><sup>[732]</sup></a> rather promising
at first his father’s virtues than the world’s
villanies; but he was so accustomed to wild and
unfruitful company about the court and London
(whither he was sent by his sober father to practise
civility and manners), that in the country he
would scarce keep till his father’s body was laid
in the cold earth; but as soon as the hasty funeral
was solemnised, from us he posted, discharging all
his old father’s servants (whose beards were even
frost-bitten with age), and was attended only by a
monkey and a marmoset;<a id='r733'></a><a href='#f733' class='c015'><sup>[733]</sup></a> the one being an ill-faced
fellow, as variable as New-fangle<a id='r734'></a><a href='#f734' class='c015'><sup>[734]</sup></a> for fashions;
the other an imitator of any thing, however villanous,
but utterly destitute of all goodness. With
this French page and Italianate serving-man was
our young landlord only waited on, and all to save
charges in servingmen, to pay it out in harlots:
and we poor men had news of a far greater expense
within less than a quarter. For we were sent for to
London, and found our great landlord in a little
room about the Strand; who told us, that whereas
we had lived tenants at will, and might in his forefathers’
days [have] been hourly turned out, he,
putting on a better conscience to usward, intended
to make us leases for years; and for advice ’twixt
him and us he had made choice of a lawyer, a
mercer, and a merchant, to whom he was much beholding,<a id='r735'></a><a href='#f735' class='c015'><sup>[735]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>who that morning were appointed to meet
in the Temple-church. Temple and church, both
one in name, made us hope of a holy meeting; but
there is an old proverb, <i>The nearer the church, the
farther from God</i>: to approve<a id='r736'></a><a href='#f736' class='c015'><sup>[736]</sup></a> which saying, we
met the mercer and the merchant, that, loving our
landlord or his land well, held him a great man
in both their books. Some little conference they
had; what the conclusion was, we poor men were
not yet acquainted with; but being called at their
leisure, and when they pleased to think upon us,
told us they were to dine together at the Horn in
Fleet-street, being a house where their lawyer resorted;
and if we would there attend them, we
should understand matter much for our good: and
in the meantime, they appointed us near the old
Temple-Garden to attend their counsellor, whose
name was master Prospero, not the great rider of
horse<a id='r737'></a><a href='#f737' class='c015'><sup>[737]</sup></a>—for I heard there was once such a one,—but
a more cunning rider, who had rid many men
till they were more miserable than beasts, and our
ill hap it was to prove his hackneys. Well, though
the issue were ill, on we went to await his worship,
whose chamber we found that morning fuller of
clients than I could ever see suppliants to heaven in
our poor parish-church, and yet we had in it three
hundred households: and I may tell it with reverence,
I never saw more submission done to God
than to that great lawyer; every suitor there offered
gold to this gowned idol, standing bareheaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>in a sharp-set morning, for it was in booted<a id='r738'></a><a href='#f738' class='c015'><sup>[738]</sup></a>
Michaelmas-term, and not a word spoke to him but
it was with the<a id='r739'></a><a href='#f739' class='c015'><sup>[739]</sup></a> bowing of the body and the submissive
flexure of the knee. Short tale to make,
he was informed of us what we were, and of our
coming up; when with an iron look and shrill voice,
he began to speak to the richest of our number,
ever and anon yerking out the word <i>fines</i>, which
served instead of a full-point to every sentence.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>But that word <i>fines</i> was no fine word, methought,
to please poor labouring husbandmen, that can
scarce sweat out so much in a twelvemonth as he
would demand in a twinkling. At last, to close up
the lamentable tragedy of us ploughmen, enters our
young landlord, so metamorphosed into the shape
of a French puppet, that at the first we started, and
thought one of the baboons had marched in in man’s
apparel. His head was dressed up in white feathers
like a shuttlecock, which agreed so well with his
brain, being nothing but cork, that two of the
biggest of the guard might very easily have tossed
him with battledores, and made good sport with
him in his majesty’s great hall. His doublet was
of a strange cut; and to shew the fury of his
humour, the collar of it rose up so high and sharp
as if it would have cut his throat by daylight. His
wings,<a id='r740'></a><a href='#f740' class='c015'><sup>[740]</sup></a> according to the fashion now, were<a id='r741'></a><a href='#f741' class='c015'><sup>[741]</sup></a> as little
and diminutive as a puritan’s ruff, which shewed
he ne’er meant to fly out of England, nor do any
exploit beyond sea, but live and die about London,
though he begged in Finsbury. His breeches, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>wonder to see, were full as deep as the middle of
winter, or the roadway between London and Winchester,
and so large and wide withal, that I think
within a twelvemonth he might very well put all
his lands in them; and then you may imagine they
were big enough, when they would outreach a thousand
acres: moreover, they differed so far from
our fashioned hose<a id='r742'></a><a href='#f742' class='c015'><sup>[742]</sup></a> in the country, and from his
father’s old gascoynes,<a id='r743'></a><a href='#f743' class='c015'><sup>[743]</sup></a> that his back-part seemed
to us like a monster; the roll of the breeches standing
so low, that we conjectured his house of office,
sir-reverence,<a id='r744'></a><a href='#f744' class='c015'><sup>[744]</sup></a> stood in his hams. All this while
his French monkey bore his cloak of three pounds
a-yard, lined clean through with purple velvet,
which did so dazzle our coarse eyes, that we
thought we should have been purblind ever after,
what with the prodigal aspect of that and his glorious
rapier and hangers<a id='r745'></a><a href='#f745' class='c015'><sup>[745]</sup></a> all bost<a id='r746'></a><a href='#f746' class='c015'><sup>[746]</sup></a> with pillars
of gold, fairer in show than the pillars in Paul’s
or the tombs at Westminster; beside, it drunk up
the price of all my plough-land in very pearl,
which stuck as thick upon those hangers as the
white measles upon hog’s flesh. When I had well
viewed that gay gaudy cloak and those unthrifty
wasteful hangers, I muttered thus to myself: That
is no cloak for the rain, sure; nor those no hangers
for Derrick;<a id='r747'></a><a href='#f747' class='c015'><sup>[747]</sup></a> when of a sudden, casting mine eyes
lower, I beheld a curious pair of boots of king
Philip’s<a id='r748'></a><a href='#f748' class='c015'><sup>[748]</sup></a> leather, in such artificial wrinkles, sets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>and plaits, as if they had been starched lately and
came new from the laundress’s, such was my ignorance
and simple acquaintance with the fashion,
and I dare swear my fellows and neighbours here
are all as ignorant as myself. But that which struck
us most into admiration, upon those fantastical boots
stood such huge and wide tops, which so swallowed
up his thighs, that had he sworn, as other gallants
did, this common oath, Would I might sink as I
stand! all his body might very well have sunk
down and been damned in his boots. Lastly, he
walked the chamber with such a pestilent gingle,<a id='r749'></a><a href='#f749' class='c015'><sup>[749]</sup></a>
that his spurs over-squeaked the lawyer, and made
him reach his voice three notes above his fee; but
after we had spied the rowels of his spurs, how we
blest ourselves! they did so much and so far exceed
the compass of our fashion, that they looked more
like the forerunners of wheelbarrows. Thus was
our young landlord accoutred in such a strange and
prodigal shape,<a id='r750'></a><a href='#f750' class='c015'><sup>[750]</sup></a> that it amounted to above two
years’ rent in apparel. At last approached<a id='r751'></a><a href='#f751' class='c015'><sup>[751]</sup></a> the
mercer and the merchant, two notable arch-tradesmen,
who had fitted my young master in clothes,
whilst they had clothed themselves in his acres, and
measured him out velvet by the thumb, whilst they
received his revenues by handfuls; for he had not
so many yards in his suit as they had yards and
houses bound for the payment, which now he was
forced to pass over to them, or else all his lands
should be put to<a id='r752'></a><a href='#f752' class='c015'><sup>[752]</sup></a> their book and to their forfeiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>neck-verse;<a id='r753'></a><a href='#f753' class='c015'><sup>[753]</sup></a> so my youngster was now at his pension,
not like a gentleman-pensioner, but like a
gentleman-spender. Whereupon entered master
Bursebell, the royal scrivener, with deeds and
writings hanged, drawn, and quartered, for the purpose:
he was a valiant scribe, I remember; his pen
lay mounted between his ear like a Tower-gun, but
not charged yet till our young master’s patrimony
shot off, which was some third part of an hour
after. By this time, the lawyer, the mercer, and
the merchant, were whispering and consulting together
about the writings and passage of the land
in very deep and sober conference; but our wiseacres
all the while, as one regardless of either land or
money, not hearkening or inquisitive after their
subtle and politic devices, held himself very busy
about the burning of his tobacco-pipe (as there is
no gallant but hath a pipe to burn about London),
though we poor simple men never heard of the
name till that time; and he might very fitly take
tobacco there, for the lawyer and the rest made
him smoke already. But to have noted the apish
humour of him, and the fantastical faces he coined
in the receiving of the smoke, it would have made
your ladyship have sung nothing but merry jigs<a id='r754'></a><a href='#f754' class='c015'><sup>[754]</sup></a>
for a twelvemonth after,—one time winding the
pipe like a horn at the Pie-corner of his mouth,
which must needs make him look like a sow-gelder,<a id='r755'></a><a href='#f755' class='c015'><sup>[755]</sup></a>
and another time screwing his face like
one of our country players, which must needs make
him look like a fool; nay, he had at least his dozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>of faces, but never a good one amongst them all;
neither his father’s face, nor the face of his grandfather,
but yet more wicked and riotous faces than
all the generation of him. Now their privy whisperings
and villanous plots began to be drawn to
a conclusion, when presently they called our smoky
landlord in the midst of his draught, who in a valiant
humour dashed his tobacco-pipe into the chimney-corner:
whereat I started, and beckoning his marmoset<a id='r756'></a><a href='#f756' class='c015'><sup>[756]</sup></a>
to me, asked him if those long white things
did cost no money? to which the slave replied very
proudly, Money! yes, sirrah; but I tell thee, my
master scorns to have a thing come twice to his
mouth. Then, quoth I, I think thy master is more
choice in his mouth than in any member else: it were
good if he used that all his body over, he would never
have need, as many gallants have, of any sweating
physic. Sweating physic! replied the marmoset;
what may thy meaning be? why, do not you ploughmen
sweat too? Yes, quoth I, most of any men
living; but yet there is a difference between the
sweat of a ploughman and the sweat of a gentleman,
as much as between your master’s apparel
and mine, for when we sweat, the land prospers,
and the harvest comes in; but when a gentleman
sweats, I wot how the gear<a id='r757'></a><a href='#f757' class='c015'><sup>[757]</sup></a> goes then. No sooner
were these words spoken but the marmoset had
drawn out his poniard half-way to make a show of
revenge, but at the smart voice of the lawyer he
suddenly whipt it in again. Now was our young
master with one penful of ink doing a far greater
exploit than all his forefathers; for what they were
a-purchasing all their lifetime, he was now passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>away in the fourth part of a minute; and that
which many thousand drops of his grandfather’s
brows did painfully strive for, one drop now of a
scrivener’s inkhorn did easily pass over: a dash of a
pen stood for a thousand acres: how quickly they
were dashed in the mouth by our young landlord’s
prodigal fist! it seemed he made no more account
of acres than of acorns. Then were we called to
set our hands for witnesses of his folly, which we
poor men did witness too much already; and because
we were found ignorant in writing, and never
practised in that black art—which I might very
fitly term so, because it conjured our young master
out of all—we were commanded, as it were, to draw
any mark with a pen, which should signify as much
as the best hand that ever old Peter Bales<a id='r758'></a><a href='#f758' class='c015'><sup>[758]</sup></a> hung
out in the Old Bailey. To conclude, I took the
pen first of the lawyer, and turning it arsy-versy,
like no instrument for a ploughman, our youngster
and the rest of the faction burst into laughter at
the simplicity of my fingering; but I, not so simple
as they laughed me for, drew the picture of a
knavish emblem, which was a plough with the
heels upward, signifying thereby that the world
was turned upside down since the decease of my
old landlord, all hospitality and good housekeeping
kicked out of doors, all thriftiness and good husbandry
tossed into the air, ploughs turned into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>trunks,<a id='r759'></a><a href='#f759' class='c015'><sup>[759]</sup></a> and corn into apparel. Then came another
of our husbandmen to set his mark by mine: he
holding the pen clean at the one side towards the
merchant and the mercer, shewing that all went
on their sides, drew the form of an unbridled colt,
so wild and unruly, that he seemed with one foot
to kick up the earth and spoil the labours of many
toiling beasts, which was fitly alluded to our wild
and unbridled landlord, which, like the colt, could
stand upon no ground till he had no ground to
stand upon.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>These marks, set down under the shape of simplicity,
were the less marked with the eyes of
knavery; for they little dreamed that we ploughmen
could have so much satire in us as to bite our
young landlord by the elbow. Well, this ended,
master Bursebell, the calves’-skin scrivener, was
royally handled, that is, he had a royal<a id='r760'></a><a href='#f760' class='c015'><sup>[760]</sup></a> put in his
hand by the merchant. And now I talk of calves’-skin,
’tis great pity, lady Nightingale, that the skins
of harmless and innocent beasts should be as instruments
to work villany upon, entangling young
novices and foolish elder brothers, which are caught
like woodcocks in the net of the law; for<a id='r761'></a><a href='#f761' class='c015'><sup>[761]</sup></a> ’tis easier
for one of the greatest fowls to slide through the
least hole of a net, than one of the least fools to
get from the lappet of a bond. By this time the
squeaking lawyer began to re-iterate that cold word
<i>fines</i>, which struck so chill to our hearts, that it
made them as cold as our heels, which were almost
frozen to the floor with standing. Yea, quoth the
merchant and the mercer, you are now tenants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>ours; all the right, title, and interest of this young
gentleman, your late landlord, we are firmly possessed
of, as you yourselves are witnesses: wherefore
this is the conclusion of our meeting; such
fines as master Prospero here, by the valuation of
the land, shall, out of his proper judgment, allot to
us, such are we to demand at your hands; therefore
we refer you to him, to wait his answer at the
gentleman’s best time and leisure. With that, they
stiffled two or three angels<a id='r762'></a><a href='#f762' class='c015'><sup>[762]</sup></a> in the lawyer’s right
hand:—right hand, said I? which hand was that,
trow ye? for it is impossible to know which is the
right hand of a lawyer, because there are but few
lawyers that have right hands, and those few make
much of them. So, taking their leaves of my young
landlord that was, and that never shall be again,
away they marched, heavier by a thousand acres at
their parting than they were before at their meeting.
The lawyer then, turning his Irish face to usward,
willed us to attend his worship the next term, when
we should further understand his pleasure. We,
poor souls, thanked his worship, and paid him his
fee out in legs;<a id='r763'></a><a href='#f763' class='c015'><sup>[763]</sup></a> when, in sight of us, he embraced
our young gentleman (I think, for a fool), and gave
him many riotous instructions how to carry himself,
which he was prompter to take than the other
to put into him; told him he must acquaint himself
with many gallants of the Inns-of-Court, and keep
rank with those that spend most, always wearing a
bountiful disposition about him, lofty and liberal;
his lodging must be about the Strand in any case,
being remote from the handicraft scent of the city;
his eating must be in some famous tavern, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>Horn, the Mitre, or the Mermaid;<a id='r764'></a><a href='#f764' class='c015'><sup>[764]</sup></a> and then after
dinner he must venture beyond sea, that is, in a
choice pair of noblemen’s oars, to the Bankside,<a id='r765'></a><a href='#f765' class='c015'><sup>[765]</sup></a>
where he must sit out the breaking-up<a id='r766'></a><a href='#f766' class='c015'><sup>[766]</sup></a> of a comedy,
or the first cut of a tragedy; or rather, if his humour
so serve him, to call in at the Blackfriars,<a id='r767'></a><a href='#f767' class='c015'><sup>[767]</sup></a>
where he should see a nest of boys able to ravish
a man. This said, our young goose-cap, who was
ready to embrace such counsel, thanked him for his
fatherly admonitions, as he termed them, and told
him again that he should not find him with the
breach of any of them, swearing and protesting he
would keep all those better than the ten commandments:
at which word he buckled on his rapier and
hangers,<a id='r768'></a><a href='#f768' class='c015'><sup>[768]</sup></a> his monkey-face casting on his cloak by
the book; after an apish congee or two, passed
down stairs, without either word or nod to us his
old father’s tenants. Nevertheless we followed
him, like so many russet servingmen, to see the
event of all, and what the issue would come to;
when, of a sudden, he was encountered by a most
glorious-spangled gallant, which we took at first to
have been some upstart tailor, because he measured
all his body with a salutation, from the flow of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>doublet to the fall of the breeches; but at last we
found him to be a very fantastical sponge, that
licked up all humours, the very ape of fashions,
gesture, and compliment,—one of those indeed, as
we learned afterward, that fed upon young landlords,
riotous sons and heirs, till either he or the
Counter in Wood-street had swallowed them up;
and would not stick to be a bawd or pander to such
young gallants as our young gentleman, either to
acquaint them with harlots, or harlots with them;
to bring them a whole dozen of taffeta punks at a
supper, and they should be none of these common
Molls neither, but discontented and unfortunate
gentlewomen, whose parents being lately deceased,
the brother ran away with all the land, and they,<a id='r769'></a><a href='#f769' class='c015'><sup>[769]</sup></a>
poor squalls,<a id='r770'></a><a href='#f770' class='c015'><sup>[770]</sup></a> with a little money, which cannot hold
out long without some comings in; but they will
rather venture a maidenhead than want a head-tire;
such shuttlecocks as these, which, though they are
tossed and played withal, go still<a id='r771'></a><a href='#f771' class='c015'><sup>[771]</sup></a> like maids, all
white on the top: or else, decayed gentlemen’s
wives, whose husbands, poor souls, lying for debt
in the King’s Bench, they go about to make monsters
in the King’s-Head tavern; for this is a general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>axiom, all your luxurious<a id='r772'></a><a href='#f772' class='c015'><sup>[772]</sup></a> plots are always begun
in taverns, to be ended in vau[l]ting-houses;<a id='r773'></a><a href='#f773' class='c015'><sup>[773]</sup></a> and
after supper, when fruit comes in, there is small
fruit of honesty to be looked for,—for you know
that the eating of the apple always betokens the
fall of Eve. Our prodigal child, accompanied
with this soaking swaggerer and admirable cheater,
who had supt up most of our heirs about London
like poached eggs, slips into White-Friars’ nunnery,<a id='r774'></a><a href='#f774' class='c015'><sup>[774]</sup></a>
whereas<a id='r775'></a><a href='#f775' class='c015'><sup>[775]</sup></a> the report went he kept his most delicate
drab of three hundred a-year, some unthrifty
gentleman’s daughter, who had mortgaged his land
to scriveners, sure enough from redeeming again;
for so much she seemed by her bringing up, though
less by her casting down. Endued she was, as we
heard, with some good qualities, though all were
converted then but to flattering villanies: she could
run upon the lute very well, which in others would
have appeared virtuous, but in her lascivious, for
her running was rather jested at, because she was
a light runner besides: she had likewise the gift of
singing very deliciously, able to charm the hearer;
which so bewitched away our young master’s money,
that he might have kept seven noise<a id='r776'></a><a href='#f776' class='c015'><sup>[776]</sup></a> of musicians
for less charges, and yet they would have stood for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>servingmen too, having blue coats<a id='r777'></a><a href='#f777' class='c015'><sup>[777]</sup></a> of their own.
She had a humour to lisp often, like a flattering
wanton, and talk childish, like a parson’s daughter;
which so pleased and rapt our old landlord’s lickerish
son, that he would swear she spake nothing but
sweetmeats, and her breath then sent forth such
a delicious odour, that it perfumed his white-satin
doublet better than sixteen milliners. Well, there
we left him, with his devouring cheater and his
glorious cockatrice;<a id='r778'></a><a href='#f778' class='c015'><sup>[778]</sup></a> and being almost upon dinner-time,
we hied us and took our repast at thrifty
mother Walker’s, where we found a whole nest of
pinching bachelors, crowded together upon forms
and benches, in that most worshipful three-halfpenny
ordinary,<a id='r779'></a><a href='#f779' class='c015'><sup>[779]</sup></a> where presently they were boarded<a id='r780'></a><a href='#f780' class='c015'><sup>[780]</sup></a>
with hot monsieur Mutton-and-porridge (a Frenchman
by his blowing); and next to them we were
served in order, every one taking their degree:
and I tell you true, lady, I have known the time
when our young landlord’s father hath been a
three-halfpenny eater there,—nay more, was the
first that acquainted us with that sparing and
thrifty ordinary, when his riotous son hath since
spent his five pound at a sitting. Well, having discharged
our small shot (which was like hail-shot in
respect of our young master’s cannon-reckonings
in taverns), we plodded home to our ploughs, carrying
these heavy news to our wives both of the
prodigality of our old landlord’s son, as also of our
oppressions to come by the burden of uncharitable
fines. And, most musical madam Nightingale, do
but imagine now what a sad Christmas we all kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>in the country, without either carols, wassail-bowls,<a id='r781'></a><a href='#f781' class='c015'><sup>[781]</sup></a>
dancing of Sellenger’s round<a id='r782'></a><a href='#f782' class='c015'><sup>[782]</sup></a> in moonshine nights
about May-poles, shoeing the mare, hoodman-blind,
hot-cockles, or any of our old Christmas gambols;
no, not so much as choosing king and queen on
twelfth night: such was the dulness of our pleasures,—for
that one word <i>fines</i> robbed us of all
our fine pastimes.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>This sour-faced Christmas thus unpleasantly past
over, up again we trotted to London, in a great frost,
I remember, for the ground was as hard as the lawyer’s
conscience; and arriving at the luxurious Strand
some three days before the term, we inquired for
our bountiful landlord, or the fool in the full, at
his neat and curious lodging; but answer was
made us by an old chamber-maid, that our gentleman
slept not there all the Christmas time, but
had been at court, and at least in five masques;
marry, now, as she thought, we might find him at
master Poops his ordinary, with half-a-dozen of
gallants more at dice. At dice? at the devil! quoth
I, for that is a dicer’s last throw. Here I began to
rail, like Thomas Nash<a id='r783'></a><a href='#f783' class='c015'><sup>[783]</sup></a> against Gabriel Harvey,
if you call that railing; yet I think it was but the
running a tilt of wits in booksellers’ shops on both
sides of John of Paul’s<a id='r784'></a><a href='#f784' class='c015'><sup>[784]</sup></a> churchyard; and I wonder
how John scaped unhorsing. But when we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>entered the door of the ordinary, we might hear
our lusty gentleman shoot off a volley of oaths some
three rooms over us, cursing the dice, and wishing
the pox were in their bones, crying out for a new
pair of square ones, for the other belike had cogged<a id='r785'></a><a href='#f785' class='c015'><sup>[785]</sup></a>
with him and made a gull of him. When the host
of the ordinary coming down stairs met us with
this report, after we had named him, Troth, good
fellows, you have named now the most unfortunatest
gentleman living, at passage<a id='r786'></a><a href='#f786' class='c015'><sup>[786]</sup></a> I mean; for I
protest I have stood by myself as a heavy eye-witness,
and seen the beheading of five hundred crowns,
and what pitiful end they all made. With that he
shewed us his embost girdle and hangers<a id='r787'></a><a href='#f787' class='c015'><sup>[787]</sup></a> new-pawned
for more money, and told us beside, not
without tears, his glorious cloak was cast away
three hours before overboard, which was, off the table.
At which lamentable hearing, we stood still in the
lower room, and durst not venture up stairs, for
fear he would have laid all us ploughmen to pawn
too; and yet I think all we could scarce have made
up one throw. But to draw to an end, as his patrimony
did, we had not lingered the better part of
an hour, but down came fencing<a id='r788'></a><a href='#f788' class='c015'><sup>[788]</sup></a> his glittering
rapier and dagger, as if he had been newly shoulder-clapt
by a pewter-buttoned sergeant and his weapons
seized upon. At last, after a great peal of
oaths on all sides, the court broke up, and the worshipful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>bench of dicers came thundering down stairs,
some singing, with such a confusion of humours,
that had we not<a id='r789'></a><a href='#f789' class='c015'><sup>[789]</sup></a> known before what rank of gallants
they were, we should have thought the devils
had been at dice in an ordinary. The first that
appeared to us was our most lamentable landlord,
dressed up in his monkey’s livery-cloak, that he
seemed now rather to wait upon his monkey than
his monkey upon him, which did set forth his satin
suit so excellent scurvily, that he looked for all
the world like a French lord in dirty boots. When
casting his eye upon us, being desirous, as it
seemed, to remember us now if we had any money,
brake into these fantastical speeches: What, my
whole warren of tenants?—thinking indeed to make
conies<a id='r790'></a><a href='#f790' class='c015'><sup>[790]</sup></a> of us,—my honest nest of ploughmen, the
only kings of Kent! More dice, ho! i’faith,<a id='r791'></a><a href='#f791' class='c015'><sup>[791]</sup></a> let’s
have another career, and vomit three dice in a
hand again. With that I plucked his humour at
one side, and told him we were indeed his father’s
tenants, but his we were sorry we were not; and
as for money to maintain his dice, we had not sufficient
to stuff out the lawyer. Then replied our
gallant in a rage, tossing out two or three new-minted
oaths, These ploughmen are politicians, I
think; they have wit, the whorsons; they will be
tenants, I perceive, longer than we shall be landlords.
And fain he would have swaggered with us,
but that his weapons were at pawn: so, marching
out like a turned gentleman, the rest of the gallants
seemed to cashier him, and throw him out of their
company like a blank die—the one having no black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>peeps<a id='r792'></a><a href='#f792' class='c015'><sup>[792]</sup></a>, nor he no white pieces. Now was our
gallant the true picture of the prodigal; and having
no rents to gather now, he gathered his wits about
him, making his brain pay him revenues in villany;
for it is a general observation, that your sons and
heirs prove seldom wise men till they have no more
land than the compass of their noddles. To conclude,
within few days’ practice he was grown as<a id='r793'></a><a href='#f793' class='c015'><sup>[793]</sup></a>
absolute in cheating, and as exquisite in pandarism,
that he outstripped all Greene’s books<a id='r794'></a><a href='#f794' class='c015'><sup>[794]</sup></a> <i>Of the Art
of Cony-catching</i>; and where<a id='r795'></a><a href='#f795' class='c015'><sup>[795]</sup></a> before he maintained
his drab, he made his drab now maintain him;
proved the only true captain of vaulting-houses,<a id='r796'></a><a href='#f796' class='c015'><sup>[796]</sup></a>
and the valiant champion against constables and
searchers; feeding upon the sin of White-Friars,
Pict-hatch, and Turnboll Street.<a id='r797'></a><a href='#f797' class='c015'><sup>[797]</sup></a> Nay, there was
no landed novice now but he could melt him away
into nothing, and in one twelvemonth make him hold
all his land between his legs, and yet but straddle
easily neither; no wealthy son of the city but within
less than a quarter he could make all his stock not
worth a Jersey stocking: he was all that might be
in dissolute villany, and nothing that should be in
his forefathers’ honesty. To speak troth, we did
so much blush at his life, and were so ashamed of
his base courses, that ever after we loathed to look
after them. But returning to our stubble-haired
lawyer, who reaped his beard every term-time (the
lawyer’s harvest), we found the mercer and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>merchant crowdd in his study amongst a company
of law-books, which they justled so often with their
coxcombs, that they were almost together by the
ears with them; when at the sight of us they took
an <i>habeas corpus</i>, and removed their bodies into a
bigger room. But there we lingered not long for
our torments; for the mercer and the merchant
gave fire to the lawyer’s tongue with a rope of
angels,<a id='r798'></a><a href='#f798' class='c015'><sup>[798]</sup></a> and the word <i>fines</i> went off with such a
powder, that the force of it blew us all into the
country, quite changed our ploughmen’s shapes,
and so we became little ants again.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>This, madam Nightingale, is the true discourse
of our rural fortunes, which, how miserable,
wretched, and full of oppression they were, all

    <div><i>The Ant’s Tale when he was a soldier.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023 prose'>Then thus, most musical and prickle-singing<a id='r805'></a><a href='#f805' class='c015'><sup>[805]</sup></a>
madam (for, if I err not, your ladyship was the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>that brought up prick-song,<a id='r806'></a><a href='#f806' class='c015'><sup>[806]</sup></a> being nothing else but
the fatal notes of your pitiful ravishment), I, not
contented long, a vice cleaving to all worldlings,
with this little estate of an ant, but stuffed with
envy and ambition, as small as I was, desired to
venture into the world again, which I may rather
term the upper hell or <i>frigida gehenna</i>, the cold-charitable
hell, wherein are all kind of devils too;
as your gentle devil, your ordinary devil, and your
gallant devil; and all these can change their shapes
too, as to-day in cowardly white, to-morrow in politic
black, a third day in jealous yellow; for believe
it, sweet lady, there are devils of all colours. Nevertheless,
I, covetous of more change, leapt out of
this little skin of an ant, and hung my skin on the
hedge, taking upon me the grisly shape of a dusty
soldier. Well made I was, and my limbs valiantly
hewn out for the purpose: I had a mazzard,<a id='r807'></a><a href='#f807' class='c015'><sup>[807]</sup></a> I
remember, so well lined in the inside with my
brain, it stood me in better stead than a double
headpiece; for the brain of a soldier, differing from
all other sciences, converts itself to no other<a id='r808'></a><a href='#f808' class='c015'><sup>[808]</sup></a> use
but to line, fur, and even quilt the coxcomb, and so
makes a pate of proof: my face was well leavened,
which made my looks taste sour, the true relish of
a man of war; my cheeks dough-baked, pale, wan,
and therefore argued valour and resolution; but
my nose somewhat hard-baked, and a little burnt
in the oven, a property not amiss in a soldier’s
visage, who should scorn to blush but in his nose;
my chin was well thatched with a beard, which was a
necessary shelter in winter, and a fly-flap in summer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>so brushy and spreading, that my lips could
scarce be seen to walk abroad, but played at all-hid,
and durst not peep forth for starting a hair. To
conclude, my arms, thighs, and legs, were so sound,
stout, and weighty, as if they had come all out of
the timber-yard, that my very presence only was
able to still the bawlingest infant in Europe. And
I think, madam, this was no unlikely shape for a
soldier to prove well; here was mettle enough for
four shillings a-week to do valiant service till it
was bored as full of holes as a skimmer. Well, to
the wars I betook me, ranked myself amongst desperate
hot shots,—only my carriage put on more
civility, for I seemed more like a spy than a follower,
an observer rather than a committer of villany.
And little thought I, madam, that the camp
had been supplied with harlots too as well as the
Curtain,<a id='r809'></a><a href='#f809' class='c015'><sup>[809]</sup></a> and the guarded tents as wicked as garden
tenements;<a id='r810'></a><a href='#f810' class='c015'><sup>[810]</sup></a> trulls passing to and fro in the
washed shape of laundresses, as your bawds about
London in the manner of starchwomen, which is
the most unsuspected habit that can be to train out
a mistress. And if your ladyship will not think me
much out of the way though I take a running leap
from the camp to the Strand again, I will discover
a pretty knavery of the same breeding between
such a starchwoman and a kind wanton mistress;
as there are few of those balassed vessels now-a-days
but will have a love and a husband.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The woman crying her ware by the door (a most
pitiful cry, and a<a id='r811'></a><a href='#f811' class='c015'><sup>[811]</sup></a> lamentable hearing that such a
stiff thing as starch should want customers), passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>cunningly and slily by the stall,<a id='r812'></a><a href='#f812' class='c015'><sup>[812]</sup></a> not once taking
notice of the party you wot on, but being by this
some three or four shops off, Mass, quoth my young
mistress to the weathercock her husband, such a
thing I want, you know: then she named how many
puffs and purls<a id='r813'></a><a href='#f813' class='c015'><sup>[813]</sup></a> lay in a miserable case for want
of stiffening. The honest plain-dealing jewel her
husband sent out a boy to call her (not bawd by
her right name, but starchwoman): into the shop
she came, making a low counterfeit curtsey, of
whom the mistress demanded if the starch were
pure gear,<a id='r814'></a><a href='#f814' class='c015'><sup>[814]</sup></a> and would be stiff in her ruff, saying
she had often been deceived before, when the things
about her have stood as limber as eelskins. The
woman replied as subtilely, Mistress, quoth she,
take this paper of starch of my hand; and if it
prove not to your mind, never bestow penny with
me,—which paper, indeed, was a letter sent to her
from the gentleman her exceeding favourite. Say
you so? quoth the young dame, and I’ll try it, i’faith.
With that she ran up stairs like a spinner upon
small cobweb ropes, not to try or arraign the starch,
but to conster<a id='r815'></a><a href='#f815' class='c015'><sup>[815]</sup></a> and parse the letter (whilst her
husband sat below by the counter, like one of these
brow-bitten catchpolls that wait for one man all
day, when his wife can put five in the counter
before him), wherein she found many words that
pleased her. Withal the gentleman writ unto her
for a certain sum of money, which no sooner was
read, but was ready to be sent: wherefore, laying
up the starch and that, and taking another sheet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>of clean paper in her hand, wanting time and opportunity
to write at large, with a penful of ink, in
the very middle of the sheet, writ these few quaint
monosyllables, <i>Coin, Cares, and Cures, and all C’s
else are yours</i>. Then rolling up the white money
like the starch in that paper very subtilely and artificially,
came tripping down stairs with these colourable
words, Here’s goodly starch indeed! fie, fie!—trust
me, husband, as yellow as the jaundice; I
would not have betrayed my puffs with it for a
million:—here, here, here (giving her the paper of
money). With that the subtle starchwoman, seeming
sorry that it pleased her not, told her, within
few days she would fit her turn with that which
should like<a id='r816'></a><a href='#f816' class='c015'><sup>[816]</sup></a> her; meaning indeed more such sweet
news from her lover. These and such like, madam,
are the cunning conveyances<a id='r817'></a><a href='#f817' class='c015'><sup>[817]</sup></a> of secret, privy, and
therefore unnoted harlots, that so avoid the common
finger of the world, when less committers than
they are publicly pointed at.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>So likewise in the camp, whither now I return,
borne on the swift wings of apprehension, the habit
of a laundress shadows the abomination of a strumpet;
and our soldiers are like glovers, for the one
cannot work well, nor the other fight well, without
their wenches. This was the first mark of villany
that I found sticking upon the brow of war; but
after the hot and fiery copulation of a skirmish or
two, the ordnance playing like so many Tamburlaines,<a id='r818'></a><a href='#f818' class='c015'><sup>[818]</sup></a>
the muskets and calivers answering like
drawers, Anon, anon, sir,<a id='r819'></a><a href='#f819' class='c015'><sup>[819]</sup></a> I cannot be here and
there too,—that is, in the soldier’s hand and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>enemy’s belly, I grew more acquainted, and, as it
were, entered into the entrails of black-livered policy.
Methought, indeed, at first, those great pieces
of ordnance should speak English, though now by
transportation turned rebels: and what a miserable
and pitiful plight it was, lady, to have so many
thousands of our men slain by their own countrymen
the cannons,—I mean not the harmless canons
of Paul’s, but those cannons that have a great singing
in their heads! Well, in this onset I remember I
was well smoke-dried, but neither arm nor leg
perished, not so much as the loss of a petty finger;
for when I counted them all over, I missed not one
of them; and yet sometimes the bullets came within
a hair of my coxcomb, even like a barber scratching
my pate, and perhaps took away the left limb of a
vermin, and so departed; another time shouldering
me like a bailiff against Michaelmas-term, and then
shaking me by the sleeve as familiarly as if we had
been acquainted seven years together. To conclude,
they used me very courteously and gentlemanlike
awhile; like an old cunning bowler to fetch
in a young ketling<a id='r820'></a><a href='#f820' class='c015'><sup>[820]</sup></a> gamester, who will suffer him
to win one sixpenny-game at the first, and then
lurch him in six pounds afterward: and so they
played with me, still training me, with their fair
promises, into far deeper and deadlier battles,
where, like villanous cheating bowlers, they lurched
me of two of my best limbs, viz. my right arm and
right leg, that so, of a man of war, I became in shew
a monster of war; yet comforted in this, because I
knew war begot many such monsters as myself in
less than a twelvemonth. Now I could discharge
no more, having paid the shot dear enough, I think,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>but rather desired to be discharged, to have pay
and begone: whereupon I appeared to my captain
and other commanders, kissing my left hand, which
then stood for both (like one actor that plays two
parts), who seemed to pity my unjointed fortunes
and plaster my wounds up with words, told me I
had done valiant service in their knowledge; marry,
as for pay, they must go on the score with me, for
all their money was thumped out in powder: and
this was no pleasing salve for a green sore, madam;
’twas too much for me, lady, to trust calivers with
my limbs, and then cavaliers with my money.
Nevertheless, for all my lamentable action of one
arm, like old Titus Andronicus,<a id='r821'></a><a href='#f821' class='c015'><sup>[821]</sup></a> I could purchase
no more than one month’s pay for a ten months’
pain and peril, nor that neither, but to convey
away my miserable clamours, that lay roaring
against the arches of their ears, marry, their bountiful
favours were extended thus far,—I had a
passport to beg in all countries.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Well, away I was packed; and after a few miseries
by the way, at last I set one foot into England
again (for I had no more then to set), being my
native though unnatural country, for whose dear
good I pawned my limbs to bullets, those merciless
brokers, that will take the vantage of a minute;
and so they were quite forfeited, lost, and unrecoverable.
When I was on shore, the people gathered,—which
word <i>gathering</i> put me in hope of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>good comfort, that afterward I failed of; for I
thought at first they had gathered something for
me, but I found at last they did only but gather
about me; some wondering at me, as if I had been
some sea-monster cast ashore, some jesting at my
deformity, whilst others laughed at the jests: one
amongst them, I remember, likened me to a sea-crab,
because I went all of one side; another fellow
vied it,<a id='r822'></a><a href='#f822' class='c015'><sup>[822]</sup></a> and said I looked like a rabbit cut up and
half-eaten, because my wing and leg, as they termed
it, were departed. Some began to pity me, but
those were few in number, or at least their pity
was as pennyless as Pierce,<a id='r823'></a><a href='#f823' class='c015'><sup>[823]</sup></a> who writ to the devil
for maintenance. Thus passing from place to place,
like the motion<a id='r824'></a><a href='#f824' class='c015'><sup>[824]</sup></a> of Julius Cæsar or the City Nineveh,
though not altogether in so good clothes, I
overtook the city from whence I borrowed my first
breath, and in whose defence I spent and laid out
my limbs by whole sums to purchase her peace
and happiness, nothing doubting but to be well
entreated<a id='r825'></a><a href='#f825' class='c015'><sup>[825]</sup></a> there, my grievous maims tenderly regarded,
my poor broken estate carefully repaired,
the ruins of my blood built up again with redress
and comfort: but woe the while, madam! I was
not only unpitied, succourless, and rejected, but
threatened with the public stocks, loathsome jails,
and common whipping-posts, there to receive my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>pay—a goodly reward for my<a id='r826'></a><a href='#f826' class='c015'><sup>[826]</sup></a> bleeding service—if
I were once found in the city again.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Wherefore I was forced to retire towards the
Spital and Shoreditch, which, as it appeared, was
the only Cole-harbor<a id='r827'></a><a href='#f827' class='c015'><sup>[827]</sup></a> and sanctuary for wenches
and soldiers; where I took up a poor lodging a’
trust till the Sunday, hoping that then master Alms
and mistress Charity would walk abroad and take
the air in Finsbury. At which time I came hopping
out from my lodging, like old lame Giles of Cripplegate;
but when I came there, the wind blew so
bleak and cold, that I began to be quite out of hope
of charity; yet, like a torn map of misery, I waited
my single halfpenny fortunes; when, of a sudden,
turning myself about, and looking down the Windmill-hill,
I might espy afar off a fine-fashioned dame
of the city, with her man bound by indenture before
her; whom no sooner I caught in mine eyelids, but
I made to with all possible speed, and with a premeditated
speech for the nonce,<a id='r828'></a><a href='#f828' class='c015'><sup>[828]</sup></a> thus, most soldier-like,
I accosted her: Sweet lady, I beseech your
beauty to weigh the estate of a poor unjointed soldier,
that hath consumed the moiety, or the one-half
of his limbs, in the dismembering and devouring
wars, that have<a id='r829'></a><a href='#f829' class='c015'><sup>[829]</sup></a> cheated me of my flesh so
notoriously, I protest I am not worth at this instant
the small revenue of three farthings, beside my
lodging unpleased<a id='r830'></a><a href='#f830' class='c015'><sup>[830]</sup></a> and my diet unsatisfied; and
had I ten thousand limbs, I would venture them all
in your sweet quarrel, rather than such a beauty as
yourself should want the least limb of your desire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>With that, as one being rather moved by my last
words of promise than my first words of pity, she
drew her white bountiful hand out of her marry-muff,<a id='r831'></a><a href='#f831' class='c015'><sup>[831]</sup></a>
and quoited a single halfpenny; whereby I
knew her then to be cold mistress Charity, both by
her chill appearance and the hard, frozen pension
she gave me. She was warm<a id='r832'></a><a href='#f832' class='c015'><sup>[832]</sup></a> lapt, I remember,
from the sharp injury of the biting air; her visage
was benighted with a taffeta-mask, to fray away
the naughty wind from her face, and yet her very
nose seemed so sharp with cold, that it almost
bored a hole quite through: this was frost-bitten
Charity; her teeth chattered in her head, and leaped
up and down like virginal-jacks<a id='r833'></a><a href='#f833' class='c015'><sup>[833]</sup></a> which betrayed
likewise who she was: and you would have broke
into infinite laughter, madam (though misery made
me leaden and pensive), had you been present, to
have seen how quickly the muff swallowed her hand
again; for no sooner was it drawn forth to drop
down her pitiful alms, but, for fear the sun and air
should have ravished it, it was extempore whipt up
again. This is the true picture of Charity, madam,
which is as cold as ice in the middle of July.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Well, still I waited for another fare; but then I
bethought myself again, that all the fares went by
water a’ Sundays to the bear-baiting,<a id='r834'></a><a href='#f834' class='c015'><sup>[834]</sup></a> and a’ Mondays
to Westminster-hall; and therefore little to be
looked for in Moorfields all the week long: wherefore
I sat down by the rails there, and fell into
these passionate,<a id='r835'></a><a href='#f835' class='c015'><sup>[835]</sup></a> but not railing speeches: Is this
the farthest reward for a soldier? are<a id='r836'></a><a href='#f836' class='c015'><sup>[836]</sup></a> valour and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>resolution, the two champions of the soul, so slightly
esteemed and so basely undervalued? doth reeling
Fortune not only rob us of our limbs, but of our
living? are soldiers, then, both food for cannon and
for misery? But then, in the midst of my passion,
calling to memory the peevish turns<a id='r837'></a><a href='#f837' class='c015'><sup>[837]</sup></a> of many
famous popular gallants, whose names were writ
even upon the heart of the world—it could not so
much as think without them, nor speak but in the
discourse of them—I began to outdare the very
worst of cruel and disaster chances, and determined
to be constant in calamity, and valiant against the
battering siege of misery. But note the cross star
that always dogged my fortunes: I had not long
rested there, but I saw the tweering<a id='r838'></a><a href='#f838' class='c015'><sup>[838]</sup></a> constable of
Finsbury, with his bench of brown-bill-men,<a id='r839'></a><a href='#f839' class='c015'><sup>[839]</sup></a> making
towards me, meaning indeed to stop some prison-hole
with me, as your soldiers, when the wars have
done with them, are good for nothing else but to
stop holes withal; at which sight, I scrambled up
of<a id='r840'></a><a href='#f840' class='c015'><sup>[840]</sup></a> all two, took my skin off the hedge, cozened
the constable, and slipt<a id='r841'></a><a href='#f841' class='c015'><sup>[841]</sup></a> into an ant again.</p>

    <div><i>The Ant’s Tale when he was a scholar.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023 prose'>You speak oracle, madam; and now suppose,
sweet lady, you see me set forth, like a poor
scholar, to the university, not on horseback, but
in Hobson’s waggon,<a id='r845'></a><a href='#f845' class='c015'><sup>[845]</sup></a> and all my pack contained
in less than a little hood-box, my books not above
four in number, and those four were very needful
ones too, or else they had never been bought; and
yet I was the valiant captain of a grammar-school
before I went, endured the assault and battery of
many unclean lashes, and all the battles I was in
stood upon points<a id='r846'></a><a href='#f846' class='c015'><sup>[846]</sup></a> much, which, once let down,
the enemy the schoolmaster would come rearward,
and do such an exploit ’tis a shame to be talked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>of. By this time, madam, imagine me slightly entertained
to be a poor scholar and servitor to some
Londoner’s son, a pure cockney, that must hear
twice a-week from his mother, or else he will be
sick ere the Sunday of a university-mulligrub.
Such a one, I remember, was my first puling
master, by whose peevish service I crept into an
old battler’s<a id='r847'></a><a href='#f847' class='c015'><sup>[847]</sup></a> gown, and so began to be a jolly
fellow. There was the first point of wit I shewed
in learning to keep myself warm; to the confirming
of which, you shall never take your true philosophers
without two nightcaps at once and better,
a gown of rug with the like appurtenances; and
who be your wise men, I pray, but they? Now,
as for study and books, I had the use of my young
master’s; for he was all day a courtier in the tennis-court,
tossing of balls instead of books, and only
holding disputation with the court-keeper how
many dozen he was in; and when any friend of
his would remember him to his book with this old
moth-eaten sentence, <i>nulla dies sine linea</i>, True, he
would say, I observe it well, for I am no day from
the line of the racket-court. Well, in the meantime,
I kept his study warm, and sucked the honey
of wit from the flowers of Aristotle—steeped my
brain in the smart juice of logic, that subtle virtue,—and
yet, for all my weighty and substantial arguments,
being able indeed to prove any thing by
logic, I could prove myself never the richer, make
the best syllogism I could: no, although I daily
rose before the sun, talked and conversed with
midnight, killing many a poor farthing candle, that
sometimes was ungently put to death when it might
have lived longer, but most times living out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>full course and hour, and the snuff dying naturally
in his bed. Nevertheless, I had entered as yet
but the suburbs of a scholar, and sat but upon the
skirts of learning: full often I have sighed when
others have snorted; and when baser trades have
securely rested in their linens, I have forced mine
eyes open, and even gagged them with capital letters,
stretching them upon the tenters of a broad
text-line when night and sleep have hung pound
weights of lead upon my eyelids.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>How many such black and ghastly seasons have
I passed over, accompanied only with a demure
watching-candle, that blinked upon Aristotle’s
works, and gave even sufficient glimmering to read
by, but none to spare! Hitherto my hopes grew
comfortable upon the spreading branches of art
and learning, rather promising future advancement
than empty days and penurious scarcity. But shall
I tell you, lady? O, here let me sigh out a full
point, and take my leave of all plenteous hours
and wealthy hopes! for in the spring of all my
perfections, in the very pride and glory of all my
labours, I was unfruitfully led to the lickerish study
of poetry, that sweet honey-poison, that swells a
supple scholar with unprofitable sweetness and delicious
false conceits, until he burst into extremities
and become a poetical almsman, or at the most, one
of the Poor Knights of Poetry, worse by odds than
one of the Poor Knights of Windsor. Marry, there
was an age once, but, alas, long since dead and
rotten, whose dust lies now in lawyers’ sand-boxes!
in those golden days, a virtuous writer might have
lived, maintained himself better upon poems than
many upon ploughs, and might have expended more
by the year by the revenue of his verse than any riotous
elder brother upon the wealthy quartridges of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>three times three hundred acres, according to the

iron-barred chest, where the prison-grates are the
locks and the key-holes, but so closely mewed, or
rather dammed up, that it never looks to walk

rot among usurers,—for I fear me the piddling gout
will never make them away soon enough; for your
rank money-masters live their threescore and ten
years as orderly as many honester men: and it is
great pity, lady Philomel, that the gout should be
such a long courtier in a usurer’s great toe, revelling
and domineering above thirty years together
in his rammish blood and his fusty flesh; and I
wonder much, madam, that gold, being the spirit

<p class='c061'>It hath been twice my fortune in short time to have
employment for this noble Society, where I have
always met with men of much understanding, and
no less bounty; to whom cost appears but as a
shadow, so there be fulness of content in the performance
of the solemnity; which that the world
may judge of, for whose pleasure and satisfaction
custom hath yearly framed it, but chiefly for the
honour of the City, it begins to present itself, not
without form and order, which is required in the

    <div><i>The first invention.</i></div>

</div>

<p class='c023 prose'>A company of Indians, attired according to the
true nature of their country, seeming for the most
part naked, are set at work in an Island of growing
spices; some planting nutmeg-trees, some other spice-trees
of all kinds; some gathering the fruits, some
making up bags of pepper; every one severally employed.
These Indians are all active youths, who,
ceasing in their labours, dance about the trees, both
to give content to themselves and the spectators.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>After this show of dancing Indians in the Island,
follows triumphantly a rich personage presenting India,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>the seat of merchandise. This India sits on the top
of an illustrious chariot; on the one side of her sits
Traffic or Merchandise, on the other side Industry,
both fitted and adorned according to the property
of their natures; Industry holding a golden ball in
her hand, upon which stands a Cupid, signifying that
industry gets both wealth and love, and, with her
associate Traffic or Merchandise, who holds a globe
in her hand, knits love and peace amongst all nations:
to the better expressing of which, if you give
attention to Industry that now sets forward to speak,
it will be yours more exactly.</p>

Fortune expressed with a silver wheel; Success

which is purposely planted near the sound of the
words, moves with a kind of affectionate joy both at
the honour of the day’s triumph and the prosperity
of Love, which by the virtue of Traffic is likely ever
to continue; and for a good omen of the everlasting
continuance of it, on the top of this curious and
triumphant pageant shoots up a laurel-tree, the
leaves spotted with gold, about which sit six celestial
figures, presenting Peace, Prosperity, Love, Unity,
Plenty, and Fidelity: Peace holding a branch of
palm; Prosperity, a laurel; Love, two joined hands;
Unity, two turtles; Plenty holding fruits; Fidelity,
a silver anchor. But before I entered so far, I should
have shewed you the zeal and love of the Frenchman
and Spaniard, which now I hope will not appear
unseasonably; who, not content with a silent joy,
like the rest of the nations, have a thirst to utter
their gladness, though understood of a small number;
which is this:</p>

utters himself to the purpose of these words:</p>

<p class='c026 prose'>This expression of their joy and love having spent
itself, I know you cannot part contented without
their several inscriptions: now the favour and help

<p class='c023 prose'>This fully expressed, I arrive now at that part
of triumph which my desire ever hastened to come
to, this Castle of Fame or Honour, which Industry
brings her sons unto in their reverend ages.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>In the front of this Castle, Reward and Industry,
decked in bright robes, keep a seat between them
for him to whom the day’s honour is dedicated,
shewing how many worthy sons of the City and of
the same Society have, by their truth, desert, and
industry, come to the like honour before him; where
on a sudden is shewn divers of the same right worshipful
Society of Grocers, manifested both by their
good government in their times, as also by their
escutcheons of arms, as an example and encouragement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>to all virtuous and industrious deservers in
time to come. And in honour of antiquity is shewn
that ancient and memorable worthy of the Grocers’
Company, Andrew Bockrill, who was mayor of
London the sixteenth year of Henry the Third, 1231,
and continued so mayor seven years together: likewise,
for the greater honour of the Company, is also
shewn in this Castle of Fame the noble Allen de la
Zouche, grocer, who was mayor of London the two-and-fiftieth
year of the same Henry the Third, which
Allen de la Zouche, for his good government in the
time of his mayoralty, was by the said King Henry
the Third made both a baron of this realm and lord
chief-justice of England: also that famous worthy,
sir Thomas Knolles, grocer, twice mayor of this honourable
city, which sir Thomas begun at his own
charge that famous building of Guildhall in London,
and other memorable works both in this city and in
his own Company; so much worthiness being the
lustre of this Castle, and ought indeed to be the
imitation of the beholder.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>My lord no sooner approaches, but Reward, a
partner with Justice in keeping that seat of honour,
as overjoyed at the sight of him, appears too free

<p class='c026 prose'>About this Castle of Fame are placed many honourable
figures, as Truth, Antiquity, Harmony, Fame,
Desert, Good Works; on the top of the Castle,
Honour, Religion, Piety, Commiseration, the works
of those whose memories shine in this Castle.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>If you look upon Truth first, you shall find her
properly expressed, holding in her right hand a sun,
in the other a fan of stars; Antiquity with a scroll
in her hand, as keeper of Honour’s records; Harmony
holding a golden lute, and Fame not without
her silver trumpet; for Desert, ’tis glorious through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>her own brightness, but holds nothing; Good Works
expressed with a college, or hospital.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>On the top of the Castle, Honour manifested by
a fair star in his hand; Religion with a temple on
her head; Piety with an altar; Commiseration with
a melting or burning heart.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>And, not to have our speakers forgotten, Reward
and Justice, with whom we entered this part of
Triumph, Reward holding a wreath of gold ready for
a deserver, and Justice furnished with her sword
and balance.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>All this service is performed before the feast,
some in Paul’s Churchyard, some in Cheapside; at
which place the whole Triumph meets, both Castle
and Island, that gave delight upon the water. And
now, as duty binds me, I commend my lord and his
right honourable guess<a id='r858'></a><a href='#f858' class='c015'><sup>[858]</sup></a> to the solemn pleasure of

Moderation and Gravity are always attendants.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The feast being ended at Guildhall, my lord, as
yearly custom invites him, goes, accompanied with
the Triumph, towards St. Paul’s, to perform the
noble and reverend ceremonies which divine antiquity
virtuously ordained, and is no less than faithfully
observed, which is no mean lustre to the City.
Holy service and ceremonies accomplished, he returns
by torchlight to his own house, the whole
Triumph placed in comely order before him; and
at the entrance of his gate, Honour, a glorious person,

shall be dish’d up first, your pastes next, your wet Suckets

and Goodiniakes, then your Comfets of all kindes; Next your
Peares, Apples, Wardens back’d, raw or rosted, and your
Orenges and Lemons sliced; and lastly, your Wafer-cakes.
Thus you shall order them in the closet: but when they goe
to the Table, you shall first send forth a dish made for shew
only, as Beast, Bird, Fish, Fowle, according to the invention:
then your Marchpane, then preserved fruite, then a Paste,
then a wet Sucket, then a dry Sucket, Marmalade, Comfets,
Apples, Peares, Wardens, Orenges and Lemons, sliced; and
then Wafers, and another dish of preserved fruites, and so
consequently all the rest before, no two dishes of one kinde

Persons. He was proportionable in all parts, and had strength
equal to height, Valour to his strength, Temper to his valour,
so that he disdained to do an injury to any single person. He
would make nothing to take two of the tallest Yeomen of the

<p class='c023 prose'><i>Black Monday</i>] “Middleton here alludes to Anthony
Munday, his rival City Poet, who had composed the Pageants
of 1605 and 1611, and perhaps others of which no copies are
known to exist. Though he this year (and the last, when
Dekker was employed) lost the office of author, he did not
lose that of supplying the apparell, &#38;c., which was his business
as a draper, and to which office only Middleton seems to have
considered him competent [see p. 245]. This virulent attack,
however, appears to have experienced no greater attention
than such violence deserved, since Munday was employed in
the three following years.” <span class='sc'>Nichols.</span>—The inscription on
Anthony’s tomb declares that he was a “citizen and <i>draper</i>:”
but I am not sure that he furnished “the apparell and porters”
for <i>The Triumphs of Truth</i> in the latter capacity; rather,
perhaps, in consequence of being keeper of the <i>properties</i> of
the pageants. In the remarks prefixed to Munday’s <i>Downfall
of the Earl of Huntington</i> (Suppl. vol. to Dodsley’s <i>Old Plays</i>),
I am surprised to find Mr. Collier doubting if Middleton
alludes to him here; and I can only suppose that when Mr. C.
wrote those remarks, his recollection of the present passage
was somewhat imperfect.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The play just mentioned is evidence that Munday’s powers
were far from contemptible. The ill will which the dramatists
appear to have borne towards him was, perhaps, called forth
by the extravagant encomium of Meres, who, in the <i>Palladis
Tamia</i>, 1598, had chosen to term him “our best plotter,”
fol. 283. With respect to the comedy called <i>The Case is
altered</i>, in which he is ridiculed under the name of Antonio
Balladino, there has been a question among critics, whether
it is the work of Ben Jonson. Gifford pronounced it to be
an early production of that poet; and he, I am confident,
would not have changed his opinion even if he had lived
to see the copy, without any author’s name on the title-page,
which some years ago was added to the collection of the Duke
of Devonshire.</p>

afternoon, they mett in the Counsell-chamber, where they and
the Lords appoynted to carry their ornaments and the assistants
putt on their roabes, the Earles and Viscounts their surcotes

hanging upon their shoulders, then their hoods and afterward
their mantles and roabes, fastned upon the shoulder
and pucking out the capuchio to hang over behinde, with their
cappes of estate and coronetts, or rather circuletts for the Viscounts.
They passed from thence over the Tarras [Terrace]

carying the Patent, the Lord Compton in his Parliament
roabes, carying the Mantle, the Lord Wentworth the Capp

with their cappes of estat on. At the Gallory-dore, the
Lord Chamberlaine mett them, and placing himself after the
Kings of Armes, presented them to the King, who satt there
with the Queen and the Prince. Garter presented the Patent
to the Lord Chamberlaine, he to the King; the King delivered
the same to Sir Ralph Winwood the Secretary, who [read the
same]; at the words <i>fecimus et creavimus</i> the Roabes were delivered
to the King, who delivered the same to the Assistants,
who invested him therwith, and the like with the Capp of
estate and the Circulett theruppon, and then the Earles Assistants
putt on their cappes of estate. When the Patent was
fully read, and he thus created Viscount Brackley, the trumpetts
and drummes standing without sounded.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>“Then was brought in the Lord Knolles, the Lord Carew
carying the Mantle, the Lord Davers the Capp of Estate,
assisted by the Earle of Suffolk Lord Treasurer and Viscount
Lisle, and in like manner created Viscount Wallingford.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>“Afterward Sir Philipp Stanhop was brought in his surcote
of scarlett, the Lord Denny carying his Roabe, the Lord
Compton and the Lord Norris assisting him, and was created
Lord Stanhop of Shelford. Then they retourned that way
they came to the Counsell-chamber, first, Viscount Brackley,
then Viscount Wallingford and the Lord Stanhop, in such
order as they went, the trumpetts and drummes sounding.”</p>

Malone conjectured that the play of Tamburlaine, generally

part by Nash,—<i>Shakespeare</i> (by Boswell), vol. iii. p. 357: but
Mr. J. P. Collier has most satisfactorily shewn that it was the
work of the former; see <i>Hist. of Engl. Dram. Poetry</i>, vol. iii.
p. 113, sqq.—The present tract, and the one which follows it
(<i>Father Hubburd’s Tales</i>), both published in 1604, prove that
Nash died during that year: he is here described (I fear too
truly) as living in a state of squalid poverty; in the next

<p class='c023 fn'><a href='#r672'>672</a>. <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>] This comedy, which was,
and deserved to be, extremely popular, may be found in
Dodsley’s <i>Old Plays</i>, vol. v. last ed. Mr. J. P. Collier (<i>Hist.
of Engl. Dram. Poet.</i>) ascribes it unhesitatingly to Drayton,
probably on some authority (besides that of Oldys) which I
do not recollect.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The following passage of <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i> has
puzzled the editors (who, by the by, choose to print it as
verse): “How now, my old <i>Jenerts bank, my horse</i>, my castle;
lie in Waltham all night, and not under the canopy of your
host Blague’s house?” Steevens (Dodsley’s <i>Old Plays</i>, vol. v.
p. 267, last ed.) says, “I once suspected this passage of corruption,
but have found reason to change my opinion. The
merry Host seems willing to assemble ideas expressive of <i>trust</i>
and <i>confidence</i>. The old quartos begin the word <i>jenert</i> with a
capital letter; and, therefore, we may suppose ‘<i>Jenert’s bank</i>’
to have been the shop of some banker, in whose possession
money could be deposited with security. The Irish still say—as
sure as <i>Burton’s Bank</i>; and our countrymen—as safe as
the <i>Bank of England</i>. We might read ‘my <i>house</i>’ instead of
‘my <i>horse</i>,’ as the former agrees better with ‘castle.’ The
services of a <i>horse</i> are of all things the most uncertain.”
Nares (<i>Gloss.</i> in v. <i>Jenert’s Bank</i>) observes, “It has been
conjectured that there was a bank called <i>Jenert’s</i>, so famous
as to be proverbial for security; but it remains to be shewn
that any country-bank existed in the seventeenth century,
much more that they were so common as for one to be famous
above the rest.... Can it be a misprint for ‘<i>Ermen’s</i> bank,’
or the old Roman road passing through Edmonton, which
might have been written ‘Irmint’s?’”—I believe we ought
to read; “How now, my old <i>jennets</i> [i. e. cavaliers, for so the
word is sometimes used], <i>bauk</i> [i. e. balk] my <i>house</i>, my castle!
lie in Waltham,” &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c023 fn'><a href='#r685'>685</a>. <i>black dogs of Newgate</i>] A tract, partly verse and partly prose,
called <i>The Blacke Dogge of Newgate: both pithie and profitable for
all Readers. London.</i> 4to. n. d. (reprinted with some additions
and alterations in 1638), was written, or at least professes to
be written, by Luke Hutton, who, for robberies and trespasses,
was hanged at York in 1598. Under the title of <i>The Black
Dog of Newgate</i>, it was the author’s design to “shadow the
knauerie, villanie, robberie, and Cunnicatching, committed
daily by diuers, who in the name of seruice and office, were
as it were, attendants at Newgate.” Sig. <span class='fss'>D</span> 2. “They will
vndertake if a man be robd by the way, they will helpe the
party offended to his money againe, or to the theeues at the
least. Likewise, if a Purse be cut, a House broken, a peece
of Plate stole, they will promise the like: mary, to further
this good peece of seruice, they must haue a Warrant procured
from some Justice at the least, that by the sayd general
Warrant, they may take vp all suspected persons: which
being obteined, then marke how notably therewith they play
the knaues, how shamefully they abuse the Justices who
graunted the Warrant, and how notoriouslie they abuse a
great sort of poore men, who neither the Warrant mentioneth,
nor the partye agreeued in any wise thought to molest or
trouble.” Sig. <span class='fss'>D</span> 3. He then proceeds to give several instances
of their various knaveries.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Stage directions, except for entrances, can be:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>in-line</dt>
    <dd>in the middle of a line and delimited with ‘[ ]’,
    </dd>
    <dt>end of line</dt>
    <dd>right-justified on the same line (where there is room), with only the leading ‘[’,
    </dd>
    <dt>next line</dt>
    <dd>right-justified on the following line, where there is insufficent room, with a hanging 
    indent, if necessary.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c023 prose'>The same convention is followed here. Since this version is wider than the
original, most directions are on the same line as the speech.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Entrances were centered and separated slightly from lines above and below. This
is rendered here as a full blank line.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The footnote scheme used lettered references, repeating a-z. On numerous
of occasions, letters were repeated, and sometimes skipped. The numeric
resequencing of notes here resolves those lapses. Footnotes are sometimes
referred to directly in a footnote by its letter designation. The few
direct references to a lettered note use the new numeric value.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The volume ends with an Index of Notes which directs the reader
to all five volumes. The following anomolies have been detected:</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The entry for the ‘game of cat’ in the Index to the Notes incorrectly
references a note on p. 427.  The note occurs on p. 527.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'><a id='ken'></a>The entry for ‘ken’ refers to p. 129 of volumn 2. While the word
is used there, there is no note provided. The intent may have been
meant to refer to note <a href='https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/75604/pg75604-images.html#f1167'>1167</a> on p. 549 of that volume.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The entry for ‘Peter-sameen’ refers to p. 214. The note appears on
p. 142, and the reference has been corrected.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The entry for ‘skeldering’ refers to p. 535 of volume 3. The note appears on
that page in volume 2. The entry has been corrected.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>The entry for ‘sound’, referring to p. 206 of volume 1, is almost
certainly in error. A note on that page glosses the word ‘swound’
(swoon). A <a href='#f856'>note</a> in the current volume for ‘sounded’
also defines the entry as ‘swooned’, which perhaps caused the
confusion. The entry has been corrected. However, this should
move that entry alphabetically, but it remains in place and is
noted below.</p>

<p class='c023 prose'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>
